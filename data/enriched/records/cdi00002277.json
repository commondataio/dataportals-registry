It helps the research data to be accessible by storing Metadata alongside datasets. Additionally, every uploaded item receives a Digital Object identifier (DOI), which allows the data to be citable and sustainable. If there are any ethical or copyright concerns about publishing a certain dataset, it is possible to publish the metadata associated with the dataset to help discoverability while sharing the data itself via a private channel through manual approval.", "owner_name": "The University of Sheffield", "owner_website": "https://sheffield.ac.uk", "owner_type": "Academy", "owner_country_iso2": "GB", "owner_country": "United Kingdom", "owner_subregion_iso3166_2": "GB-ENG", "owner_subregion_name": "England", "data_themes": ["Science, technology and innovation"], "geotopics": ["Research Data Storage/Repository (not a geographic theme, no relevant ISO19115:2003 topic; if explicit geo themes are required, these should be identified from specific datasets)"], "tags": ["research data", "figshare"], "uid": "cdi00002277", "id": "figshareshefacuk"}
