It offers both a web-based user interface and an API for machine-to-machine query, and is populated by ISO 19115 metadata records that describe the observations taken and forecast model outputs produced by the RAs and DACs using DMAC-recommended standard vocabularies and data formats. The Catalog harvests metadata from registered sources on a daily basis, enabling users to discover and access ocean observing data products.", "owner_name": "U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS)", "owner_website": "https://ioos.noaa.gov/", "owner_type": "Central government", "owner_country_iso2": "US", "owner_country": "United States", "owner_subregion_iso3166_2": "USA", "owner_subregion_name": "", "data_themes": ["environment", "science and technology"], "geotopics": ["climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere", "oceans", "environment", "geoscientificInformation"], "tags": ["ocean observing", "DMAC", "meteorology", "geospatial data", "forecasts", "netCDF", "ISO 19115", "CKAN", "SOS", "OPeNDAP"], "uid": "cdi00001623", "id": "dataioosus"}
