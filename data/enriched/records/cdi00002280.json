If there are any ethical or copyright concerns about publishing a certain dataset, it is possible to publish the metadata associated with the dataset to help discoverability while sharing the data itself via a private channel through manual approval.", "owner_name": "University of Auckland", "owner_website": "https://auckland.figshare.com", "owner_type": "Academy", "owner_country_iso2": "NZ", "owner_country": "New Zealand", "owner_subregion_iso3166_2": "NZ-AUK", "owner_subregion_name": "Auckland", "data_themes": [], "geotopics": [], "tags": ["biological sciences", "family and household studies", "gender studies", "humanities", "social sciences", "life sciences", "natural sciences", "engineering sciences"], "uid": "cdi00002280", "id": "aucklandfigsharecom"}
