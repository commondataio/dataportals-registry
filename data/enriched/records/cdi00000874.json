{"name": "GigaDB", "description": "GigaDB primarily serves as a repository to host data and tools associated with articles published by GigaScience Press; however, it also includes a subset of datasets that are not associated with GigaScience articles. GigaDB defines a dataset as a group of files (e.g., sequencing data, analyses, imaging files, software programs) that are related to and support an article or study. Each dataset in GigaDB is assigned a DOI for citation, and all datasets require a title, author list, and abstract. Datasets are encouraged to include detailed information in ISA-Tab format, and all data is under a CC0 waiver.", "owner_name": "GigaScience Press", "owner_website": "http://www.gigadb.org", "owner_type": "Academy", "owner_country_iso2": "", "owner_country": "", "owner_subregion_iso3166_2": "", "owner_subregion_name": "", "data_themes": [], "geotopics": [], "tags": ["Open Access", "Repository", "Genomics", "Bioinformatics", "Life Sciences", "CC0 waiver", "DataCite DOI"], "uid": "cdi00000874", "id": "gigadborg"}
