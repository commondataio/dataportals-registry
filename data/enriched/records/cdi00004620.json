{"name": "Lineage Landscape", "description": "A comprehensive database that records datasets collected from wide-ranging developmental stages, across different species and omics datasets, including transcriptomics, single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics, with plans to expand to genomics and proteomics. It provides lineage differentiation-related genes and allows exploration of gene expression changes associated with lineage differentiation from early embryogenesis to postnatal development, and includes data from aged individuals. All data is available for direct download.", "owner_name": "ISC Research", "owner_website": "http://data.iscr.ac.cn", "owner_type": "Academy", "owner_country_iso2": "CN", "owner_country": "China", "owner_subregion_iso3166_2": null, "owner_subregion_name": null, "data_themes": ["Life Sciences", "Health"], "geotopics": ["Biota"], "tags": ["genomics", "transcriptomics", "single-cell", "epigenomics", "lineage", "development", "aging"], "uid": "cdi00004620", "id": "dataiscraccn"}
