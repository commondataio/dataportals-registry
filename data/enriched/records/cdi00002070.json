{"name": "pandoradata.earth", "description": "Pandora promotes data communities and networking. It offers new tools to handle and model data plus AI methods to investigate historical causation. Pandora seeks a better understanding of the human story by offering technological solutions to make historical and archaeological data more accessible and easily findable. It is a grassroots initiative where research communities from across various academic disciplines self-curate datasets and self-manage community membership and roles. These datasets may be deposited externally or within the Pandora data platform itself. Datasets can be assigned DOIs and are indexed so that they are findable using scientific search engines.", "owner_name": "IsomemoPandora research communities", "owner_website": "https://pandoradata.earth", "owner_type": "Academy", "owner_country_iso2": null, "owner_country": null, "owner_subregion_iso3166_2": null, "owner_subregion_name": null, "data_themes": ["Science, technology and research", "Population and society"], "geotopics": ["Society", "ImageryBaseMapsEarthCover"], "tags": ["historical data", "archaeological data", "AI modeling", "data communities", "networking", "interdisciplinary"], "uid": "cdi00002070", "id": "pandoradataearth"}
