{"name": "ODISSEI Portal", "description": "The ODISSEI Portal allows researchers to find high-quality metadata from the most important Dutch social science data collections. The Portal currently includes metadata from the microdata catalogue of Statistics Netherlands (CBS), the LISS panel, the DANS SSH Data Station, the Historical Sample of the Netherlands (HSN) and DataverseNL. An expansion to include metadata from all datasets developed in the ODISSEI Observatory is forthcoming. The Portal adds rich variable-level information, harmonizes metadata through the CESSDA Metadata Model (CMM), and allows advanced semantic searches. Metadata is stored in a knowledge graph and is linked to Controlled Vocabularies like ELSST.", "owner_name": "ODISSEI (Open Data Infrastructure for Social Science and Economic Innovations)", "owner_website": "https://odissei-data.nl", "owner_type": "Academy", "owner_country_iso2": "NL", "owner_country": "Netherlands", "owner_subregion_iso3166_2": null, "owner_subregion_name": null, "data_themes": ["Social Science"], "geotopics": null, "tags": ["social science", "metadata", "Open Data", "Netherlands"], "uid": "cdi00001195", "id": "portalodisseinl"}
