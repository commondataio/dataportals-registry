{"name": "SURF Data Repository", "description": "A user-friendly web-based data publication platform that allows researchers to store, annotate and publish research datasets of any size to ensure long-term preservation and availability of their data. The service allows any dataset to be stored, independent of volume, number of files and structure. A published dataset is enriched with complex metadata, unique identifiers are added and the data is preserved for an agreed-upon period of time. The service is domain-agnostic and supports multiple communities with different policy and metadata requirements.", "owner_name": "SURFsara", "owner_website": "https://repository.surfsara.nl", "owner_type": "Academy", "owner_country_iso2": "NL", "owner_country": "Netherlands", "owner_subregion_iso3166_2": null, "owner_subregion_name": null, "data_themes": ["Research Data"], "geotopics": ["Not Applicable"], "tags": ["multidisciplinary", "research data", "long-term preservation", "metadata", "publishing platform"], "uid": "cdi00004480", "id": "repositorysurfsaranl"}
