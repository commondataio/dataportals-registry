{"name": "CaltechDATA (data.caltech.edu)", "description": "The CaltechDATA repository offers standard data preservation and DOI (permanent identifier) services, enabling researchers to upload research data, link data with their publications, and assign a permanent DOI so that others can reference the data set. All data is preserved using the OAIS reference model, and multiple copies of all data sets are stored at the Caltech Library and remotely. CaltechDATA is intended as a long-term data repository and it is expected that data will be available for the foreseeable future. At a minimum, all data will be preserved by Caltech Library at least 5 years past the tenure of the grant. The repository is managed by Caltech Library and built on InvenioRDM.", "owner_name": "Caltech Library", "owner_website": "https://library.caltech.edu/data-management", "owner_type": "Academy", "owner_country_iso2": "US", "owner_country": "United States", "owner_subregion_iso3166_2": "US-CA", "owner_subregion_name": "California", "data_themes": ["research"], "geotopics": ["Not applicable"], "tags": ["research data", "DOI", "open access", "data management plan", "long-term preservation", "InvenioRDM"], "uid": "cdi00001677", "id": "datacaltechedu"}
