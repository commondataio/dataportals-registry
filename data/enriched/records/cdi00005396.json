{"name": "Place-based Longitudinal Data Resource", "description": "The PLDR brings together datasets that track changes in the determinants of health and health outcomes, in places over time. These are used by researchers, local government, the NHS and the third sector to understand what works to improve public and health outcomes, what doesn\u2019t and what can cause harm. The PLDR uses local and national datasets (e.g. hospital admissions data, budgetary data, prescribing data) to calculate indicators for places (neighbourhoods, local government areas, regions and countries) that are consistent over time.", "owner_name": "NIHR ARC NWC", "owner_website": "https://pldr.org", "owner_type": "Academy", "owner_country_iso2": "GB", "owner_country": "United Kingdom", "owner_subregion_iso3166_2": "GB-ENG", "owner_subregion_name": "England", "data_themes": ["health", "finance"], "geotopics": ["health", "society"], "tags": ["longitudinal data", "public health", "social care", "finance", "place-based"], "uid": "cdi00005396", "id": "pldrorg"}
