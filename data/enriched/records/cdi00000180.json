{"name": "spatiotemporal-asset-catalog", "description": "STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) is a standard that provides a common structure for exposing and cataloging geospatial data, such as imagery, SAR, point clouds, data cubes, and more. STAC enables access to different spatial data formats and provides a common way to find information about a geographic location over time. The main components are Item, Catalog, and Collection. The 'catalog.json' typically serves as the entry point for navigating the catalog structure, which can be compared to a directory tree, grouping other catalogs, collections, and items for discovery and browsing.", "owner_name": "STAC (community/implementer)", "owner_website": "https://stacspec.org", "owner_type": "Business", "owner_country_iso2": "International", "owner_country": "International", "owner_subregion_iso3166_2": null, "owner_subregion_name": null, "data_themes": ["Environment"], "geotopics": ["imageryBaseMapsEarthCover"], "tags": ["geospatial", "imagery", "catalog", "STAC", "SAR", "point clouds", "data cubes", "metadata"], "uid": "cdi00000180", "id": "cbers"}
