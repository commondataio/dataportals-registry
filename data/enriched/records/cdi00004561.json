{"name": "SciCat metadata catalogue for scientific research data.", "description": "A central data catalogue for storing the metadata of data taken at the Photon Science facilities SLS and SwissFEL in the form of datasets. Each dataset is uniquely identified with a globally unique persistent identifier (PID). The data are tagged with metadata and can be archived in a Petabyte Archive System. The system enables scientists to catalogue their data safely for long-term, allowing the data to be annotated and published in agreement with the FAIR principles.", "owner_name": "PSI (Paul Scherrer Institut)", "owner_website": "https://www.psi.ch", "owner_type": "Academy", "owner_country_iso2": "CH", "owner_country": "Switzerland", "owner_subregion_iso3166_2": "CH-AG (Aargau, canton)", "owner_subregion_name": "Aargau", "data_themes": ["scienceTechnology"], "geotopics": ["scientificResearch"], "tags": ["research", "photon science", "SLS", "SwissFEL", "SciCat", "FAIR principles"], "uid": "cdi00004561", "id": "discoverypsich"}
