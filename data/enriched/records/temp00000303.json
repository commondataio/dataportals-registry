{"name": "IFREMER-SISMER Portail de donn\u00e9es marines", "description": "SISMER (Scientific Information Systems for the Sea) is Ifremer's service in charge of managing numerous marine databases and information systems which Ifremer is responsible for implementing. The information systems managed by SISMER range from CATDS (SMOS satellite data) to geoscience data (bathymetry, seismics, geological samples), not forgetting water column data (physics and chemistry, data for operational oceanography \u2013 Coriolis - Copernicus CMEMS), fisheries data (Harmonie), coastal environment data (Quadrige 2) and deep-sea environment data (Archim\u00e8de). SISMER therefore plays a pivotal role in marine database management both for Ifremer and for many national, European and international projects.", "owner_name": "French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea - Ifremer", "owner_website": "https://data.ifremer.fr/", "owner_type": "Academy", "owner_country_iso2": "FR", "owner_country": "France", "owner_subregion_iso3166_2": "FR-E", "owner_subregion_name": "Brittany", "data_themes": ["Environment", "Science and Technology"], "geotopics": ["Oceans", "Environment", "Geoscientific Information"], "tags": ["Oceanography", "Marine biology", "Fisheries", "Geoscience", "Satellite data", "Operational oceanography", "Coastal environment", "Deep-sea environment"], "uid": "temp00000303", "id": "endataifremerfr"}
