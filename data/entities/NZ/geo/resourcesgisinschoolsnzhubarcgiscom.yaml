description: "GIS in Schools Free mapping tools and activities for Schools in New\
  \ Zealand and the South Pacific What is GIS? Geographic Information Systems (GIS)\
  \ are used to capture, manage, display, and analyse location-based data. You can\
  \ use GIS to enhance students geographic understanding, to provide location-based\
  \ narratives and allow deeper understanding of location information across many\
  \ disciplines including geography, history, science, environmental studies, agriculture\
  \ and beyond. Currently, GIS is officially part of the New Zealand Geography Curriculum\
  \ at NCEA level 1, 2, and 3. Visit the What is GIS? page for more information about\
  \ the Esri ArcGIS Tools. Eagle Technology, as the New Zealand Esri distributor,\
  \ provides free access to GIS via ArcGIS Online for all schools in New Zealand and\

  \ that makes teaching \nwith GIS easy. There is no install, you just need a browser\
