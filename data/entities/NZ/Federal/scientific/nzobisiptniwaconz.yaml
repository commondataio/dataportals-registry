description: The Southwestern Pacific OBIS Node site is a gateway to marine biodiversity
  data from the Ross Sea (Antarctica), the Southern Ocean south of New Zealand, the
  New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone, and surrounding seas, including those to the
  north as far as Fiji. As they become available, more new data sets will be added
  to this site and to the main OBIS site. More than 20 OBIS nodes around the world
  connect 500 institutions from 56 countries. Collectively, they have provided over
  45 million observations of nearly 120 000 marine species, from Bacteria to Whales,
  from the surface to 10 900 meters depth, and from the Tropics to the Poles. The
  datasets are integrated so you can search and map them all seamlessly by species
  name, higher taxonomic level, geographic area, depth, time and environmental parameters.
  OBIS emanates from the Census of Marine Life (2000-2010) and was adopted as a project
  under IOC-UNESCO’s International Oceanographic Data and Information (IODE) programme
  in 2009.
