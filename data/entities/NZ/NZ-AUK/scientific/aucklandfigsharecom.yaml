description: The FigShare service for University of Auckland, New Zealand was launched
  in January 2015 and allows researchers to store, share and publish research data.
  It helps research data to be accessible by storing Metadata alongside datasets.
  Additionally, every uploaded item receives a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), which
  allows the data to be cited. If there are any ethical or copyright concerns about
  publishing a certain dataset, it is possible to publish the metadata associated
  with the dataset to help discoverability while sharing the data itself via a private
  channel through manual approval.
