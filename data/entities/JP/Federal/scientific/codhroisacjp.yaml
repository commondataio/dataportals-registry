description: We provide three types of datasets, namely Kuzushiji-MNIST、Kuzushiji-49、Kuzushiji-Kanji,
  for different purposes. Pre-Modern Japanese Text, owned by National Institute of
  Japanese Literature, consists of image and text data and was released as open data.
  Some books also have summary, transcription, and tagging data. Cooking books in
  the Edo period, provided from Dataset of Pre-Modern Japanese Text, were curated
  for creating recipe datasets through the process of transcription, translation to
  modern Japanese, and structuring into the recipe format. As a by-product of transcription
  for the Dataset of Pre-Modern Japanese Text (PMJT), shapes and coordinates of old
  Japanese characters (Kuzushiji) were compiled to create another dataset for training
  to make machines and humans smarter. Adapted from Kuzushiji Dataset, KMNIST dataset
  is a drop-in replacement for MNIST dataset. We provide three types of datasets,
  namely Kuzushiji-MNIST、Kuzushiji-49、Kuzushiji-Kanji, for different purposes. Seal
  Script Dataset is a machine learning-friendly dataset of 'Tensho' character images
  cropped from old dictionaries of characters from Japan and China to be used for
  the interpretation of seals.... Based on the results of digitization of magazines
  published in the early to mid-Meiji period (modern magazines), we release machine
  learning datasets for OCR and develop OCR software (Kindai-OCR).
