description: The portal shares records of digital collections, academic research projects,
  repositories and publications to generate new knowledge. It works as an online access
  point to search university collections authorized for their use, reuse and free
  redistribution by anyone, without copyright restrictions, patents or other control
  mechanisms, as long as the Terms of Free Use for UNAM Open Data are respected. The
  portal contains data, digital objects and geospatial layers of biological collections,
  artistic work, music, veterinary medicine, university projects, among others. It
  allows databases to be consulted and downloaded in open and structured formats.
  One of the most outstanding collections is the National Herbarium of Mexico (MEXU),
  with almost two million records and high resolution images of plants around the
  world, mainly collected in Mexico.
