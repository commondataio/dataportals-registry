description: "The UAE's main platform for the Sustainable Development  Goals! The\
  \ United Arab Emirates (UAE) is leading the way in its commitment to achieving the\
  \ United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through its innovative SDG\
  \ Data Hub. Established in January 2017, and chaired by Her Excellency Reem bint\
  \ Ebrahim Al Hashimy – Minister of State for International Cooperation, the UAE\
  \ National  Committee on SDGs comprises 17 federal entities tasked with monitoring\
  \ and reporting progress towards the goals.\nThe SDG Data Hub is a comprehensive\
  \ platform that aims to track, monitor, and report milestones and progress towards\
  \ the implementation of the SDGs in the UAE. It features four main elements that\
  \ make it unique and engaging: open data on SDG Indicators, Data Stories, Initiatives\
  \ and Media section. The UAE acknowledges that countries cannot achieve the SDGs\
  \ unless citizens and residents are aware of the goals. Transforming the UAE’s sustainability\
  \ aspirations into initiatives makes it easier for communities to participate and\
  \ implement the SDGs. Hence, the HUB pioneered and launched  the ‘initiative’ element,\
  \ in collaboration with National Committee members, the private sector and various\
  \ stakeholders in the UAE. The objective of the HUB is to highlight key projects,\
  \ related to SDGs, to educate and increase whole-of-society’s SDG knowledge through\
  \ interactive and engaging tools. Initiatives Explore Spatially Referenced Data\
  \ by Goal This section makes data of the global SDG Indicators database readily\n\
  \        available as geospatial data web services, suitable for the production\
  \ of maps and other data visualizations\n        and analyses, and easy to download\
