description: "The Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) is free open-source software\
  \ developed by GBIF and used by organizations around the world to create and manage\
  \ repositories for sharing/publishing biodiversity datasets in standardized formats.\
  \ It enables users to map their datasets to the Darwin Core standard, package them\
  \ into a Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A), and make them accessible through GBIF and\
  \ other biodiversity portals. The IPT streamlines the process of data standardization,\
  \ metadata documentation, and sharing, ensuring datasets are interoperable and globally\
  \ discoverable.\r\n\r\nThis instance of IPT is used by the Ministry of Environmental\
  \ Protection and Green Transition in Republic of Croatia as a part of a national\
  \ BioAtlas system.\r\nFor more detailse see: https://www.gbif.org/ipt"
