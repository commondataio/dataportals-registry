description: GigaDB primarily serves as a repository to host data and tools associated
  with articles published by GigaScience Press; however, it also includes a subset
  of datasets that are not associated with GigaScience articles. GigaDB defines a
  dataset as a group of files (e.g., sequencing data, analyses, imaging files, software
  programs) that are related to and support an article or study. Each dataset in GigaDB
  is assigned a DOI for citation, and all datasets require a title, author list, and
  abstract. Datasets are encouraged to include detailed information in ISA-Tab format,
  and all data is under a CC0 waiver.
