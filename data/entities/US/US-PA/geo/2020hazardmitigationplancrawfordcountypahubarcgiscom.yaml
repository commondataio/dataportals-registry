description: 'Crawford County, Pennsylvania Crawford County''s 2020 Hazard Mitigation
  Plan describes actions to be taken to help reduce or eliminate long-term risks caused
  by hazards or disasters, such natural disasters. As the costs of disasters continue
  to rise, Crawford County must find ways to reduce hazard risks to our communities.
  This resource provides a snapshot of the planning process and resulting actionable
  items. Achieving our Vision Prior to preparing the written document, Crawford County
  must complete a robust planning process recommended by the Federal Emergency Management
  Agency and Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency. The categories below provide
  a brief description on each phase of the process. Build the Planning Team Crawford
  County developed a list of key stakeholders who are tasked with helping to identify
  key projects and hazards that are evaluated during the planning process. These stakeholders
  include, but are not limited to, local government leaders, fire departments, police
  departments, ambulance companies, school districts, federal and state agencies,
  local businesses, and non-profit entities. Gather the Tools In order to understand
  what the 2020 Hazard Mitigation Plan needs to include we have to pull together all
  of the necessary resources. These tools include: Engage the Planning Team Engaging
  key stakeholders is the most critical portion of the planning process. It enables
  us to develop a community profile to determine what has changed since the last plan.
  It also provides the stakeholders the opportunity to share their thoughts about
  what hazards our communities may face in the future. Actionable Strategies Does
  your community have an issue that needs addressed? Are you concerned as a citizen,
  business owner, local official or community group about a specific hazard or problem
  area? Then we want to hear about it! Crawford County is developing a continuous
  database of concerns regarding hazards. Help us by completing the survey below so
  we know what to focus on in either this or future planning efforts to improve our
  County. Update Capacity &amp; Risk Assessment This is the biggest and most time
  intensive section of the planning process. This is where the County''s Planning
  Team synthesizes the data and research conducted up to this point to answer some
  of the following questions: Have you had any more hazard events in the last five
  years?Have you identified all the critical facilities within the County?Has there
  been any damaging storms, accidents, or incidents since the last plan?Has the County''s
  hazard priorities changed since the last plan? Click link to view the 2020 Official

  and data below summarize the analysis conducted throughout Crawford County''s 2020
  hazard mitigation process. This information will help shape the County''s understanding
  of where hazards might occur, where they have occurred, and how we can work to prevent
  or prepare for future incidents. Action Strategies In order to be eligible for hazard
  mitigation funding, local communities must participate in the process by providing
  at least one actionable project for inclusion in the plan. Once the Plan is completed,
  citizens can click on the image below to see the Plan''s action matrix. To see the
  full report, click here. Frequently Asked Questions We understand that hazard mitigation
  planning may be a new or confusing subject for members of the general public; therefore,
  we have attempted to answer as many frequently asked questions as possible. What
  is a Hazard Mitigation Plan? Why is it important to develop a Hazard Mitigation
  Plan? What hazards will the mitigation plan address? Who is involved? As a citizen,
  how does this effort affect me? A Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP) is created to protect
  the health, safety and economic interests of residents by reducing the impacts of
  natural hazards through mitigation planning, awareness and implementation of mitigation
  alternatives.  Hazard mitigation is any action taken to permanently eliminate or
  reduce the long-term risk to human life and property from natural hazards.  It is
  an essential element of emergency management, along with preparedness, response
  and recovery.  The plan will serve as a foundation for hazard mitigation activities
  within Crawford County. The federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 requires the
  development of a Hazard Mitigation Plan as a condition of receiving mitigation funds
  should a disaster occur.  If a community identifies projects that can be implemented
  prior to a disaster and that can mitigate the potential impacts of a hazard, the
  community may apply for funding to implement the proposed mitigation alternative. 
  To be eligible for implementation funding, communities must have Hazard Mitigation
  Plans approved by both the state and FEMA. At a minimum, the plan must address the
  natural hazards of concern that could impact the Crawford County. It may also include
  a select number of technological or human caused hazards. It should also be noted
  that there are many secondary hazards that are directly attributable to these primary
  hazards that will also be addressed by the plan as part of the analysis of the primary
  hazard of concern. The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 has defined a “local government”
  as: Any county, municipality, city, town, public authority, school district, special
  district, intrastate district, council of governments (regardless of whether the
  council of governments is incorporated as a nonprofit corporation under State law),
  regional or interstate government entity, or agency or instrumentality of a local
  government; any Indian tribe or authorized tribal organization, or Alaska Native
  village or organization; and any rural community, unincorporated town or village,
  or other public entity. Any local government wishing to pursue funding afforded
  under FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Programs must have an approved hazard mitigation
  plan in order to be eligible to apply for these funds. As a citizen within a participating
  jurisdiction, you will be able to reap the benefits of the risk reduction actions
  identified by your local government. Sometimes these can be a direct impact to your
  property in the form of reduced insurance premiums and reduced risk if you live
  in a high hazard area. Most of the time, these benefits are secondary. By reducing
  risk exposure, your local government does not have to expend as many resources on
  preparedness, response or recovery from the impacts of natural hazards. Resources
