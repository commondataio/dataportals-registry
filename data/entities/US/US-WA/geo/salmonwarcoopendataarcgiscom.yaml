  Washington State created an unprecedented grassroots effort

  to keep one of the nation’s most complex Endangered Species Act recovery

  efforts under local control. The Legislature empowered lead entities in

  salmon-bearing watersheds to engage their communities to find local solutions

  to the problems facing wild salmon. Strong recovery plans and effective on-the-ground
  projects

  mean cleaner rivers and streams, healthier watersheds, and more fish. Learn More
  Learn more about grassroots salmon recovery. Watershed Health Monitoring The Washington
  Department of Ecology''s Watershed Health Monitoring program samples randomly selected
  streams and rivers across the state to answer questions about the overall condition
  of watersheds (see map). The department evaluates water quality and other biological
  and landscape indicators. It follows strict data quality and management standards
  to gain an accurate picture of watershed health. This allows Ecology to obtain a
  consistent, objective picture of biological, chemical, and habitat conditions and
  trends. Learn More Learning Center - Salmon Research Designing monitoring programs
  for salmon is complicated. There is a proliferation of technical references on sampling
  design, fish monitoring indicators, field protocols, and resource management goals.
  Here are some resources that might help you design your next monitoring project.
  - Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Partnership (PNAMP)  monitoring advisor on
  latest trends in monitoring. - Salmon Recovery Portal tracks restoration projects
  by salmon recovery region. - Salmon Recovery Funding Board''s monitoring program
  includes project effectiveness monitoring, intensively monitored watersheds, and
  fish-in and fish-out data.'
