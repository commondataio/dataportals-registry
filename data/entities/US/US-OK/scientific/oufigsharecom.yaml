description: Figshare is a cloud-based institutional repository for storing, sharing,
  and publishing research outputs including datasets, files, articles, and other digital
  content. It supports a wide range of metadata and visibility options, including
  public, embargoed, confidential, and metadata-only items, and allows for various
  types of content ownership and discoverability. Items can be assigned unique identifiers
  (DOIs), categorized, and mapped to common metadata standards like DataCite.
