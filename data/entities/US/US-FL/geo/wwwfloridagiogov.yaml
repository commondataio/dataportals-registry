description: Coordinating Geospatial Innovation for Florida's Future Mission Vision
  To act as the lead office of the executive branch for the development and review
  of policies, practices, and standards related to geospatial data managed by state
  agencies and water management districts. Florida's State Geographic Information
  Office shall coordinate and promote geospatial data sharing throughout the state
  government and serve as the primary point of contact for statewide geographic information
  systems projects, grants and resources. By fostering an innovative environment where
  stakeholders work together, Florida benefits from the creation and distribution
  of discoverable and accessible spatial data for the public. The office strives to
  elevate the quality and use of geospatial sciences and technologies to support the
  diverse and critical missions of Florida’s state agencies and water management districts.
  Cultivating active regional partnerships improves our ability to provide actionable
  geospatial data for decision making to improve Florida's future.
