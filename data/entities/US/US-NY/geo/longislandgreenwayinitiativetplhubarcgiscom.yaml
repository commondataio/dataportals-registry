description: 'An extension of the Empire State Trail The Project In 2017, Governor
  Cuomo announced the Empire State Trail, a continuous 750-mile route slated to become
  the longest multi-use trail in the country. It will span the state from Plattsburgh
  and Buffalo to New York City. But it ends in Manhattan—leaving out the 7.8 million
  New Yorkers who live east of the city. The Trust for Public Land has a plan to change
  that by creating a historic trail that will connect the residents of Long Island
  (including Brooklyn and Queens) to the Empire State Trail. Our Progress Feasibility
  Study Phase 1 Community Outreach Design + Construction 2018-2019 We started by identifying
  a feasible 175-mile east-west route across Long Island using GIS analysis and gathering
  input from the local community. 2019-2020 We conducted a detailed ground survey,
  analyzed infrastructure, identified access points, held stakeholder meetings, and
  addressed maintenance issues. 2020-current We''re seeking feedback from residents,
  business leaders, government officials and even you. Please fill out this survey
  with your input. 2021-2022 The State of New York will construct the first 25 miles
  of the Long Island Greenway. Long Island Greenway LongIslandGreenway Off-Road Miles

  and road crossings are under discussion with town and county officials and are
