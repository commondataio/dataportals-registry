description: A welcoming, safe, inclusive community with housing, employment, education,
  transportation, and recreational opportunities that fulfill the needs of our diverse
  population; a city where business, culture, and the arts thrive; where the natural
  environment is valued and where public spaces are accessible; where we acknowledge
  our history and address regional, social, and economic trends to plan for an equitable
  and sustainable future. What is a Comprehensive Plan? A comprehensive plan is an
  official, long range planning document that provides policy guidance for future
  growth and development, housing, infrastructure, and public services. Once adopted
  by the Common Council, the plan provides the foundation for future decisions on
  development and zoning, capital spending, and general policy decisions. Public input
  is critical to ensure that the priorities expressed in the plan are consistent with
  the community’s vision for the future. Imagine Plan Implement Outreach, Data Collection,
  Analysis Engagement, Visioning, Goals Implementation of Policy Recommendations onewp@whiteplainsny.gov
