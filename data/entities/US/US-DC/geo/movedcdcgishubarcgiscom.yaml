  District of Columbia’s A Message From Mayor Muriel Bowser Dear Washingtonians: Washington,
  DC is growing, and we owe it to our current and future residents to provide a transportation
  system that is safe, sustainable, and equitable. DDOT is preparing for this bright
  future: in addition to delivering complex projects like the beautiful new Frederick
  Douglass Memorial Bridge, we have launched environmentally sustainable transportation
  options like the DC Streetcar, and we have transformed the DC Circulator into the
  best way to connect and access our diverse and beautiful neighborhoods. Our goal
  is to make transit more efficient with projects that create dedicated space for
  buses like our Car Free Lanes and the K Street Transitway, the first such project
  that will help buses move quicker through the downtown core. Along the way, with
  the help of federal and community stakeholders and partners, we have made Washington,
  DC into one of the nation’s most bicycle-friendly cities. But we are not done yet!
  Our Vision Zero initiative brings together engineering, education, and enforcement
  resources from across District government to create safe streets for everyone. moveDC
  is our long-range transportation plan, built on a framework of goals: safety, equity,
  mobility, project delivery, management and operations, sustainability, and enjoyable
  spaces. It reflects our commitment to not only provide excellent transportation
  facilities and services, but to deliver them in a manner that addresses structural
  injustices and inequities. moveDC’s goals, policies, and strategies put this commitment
  into practice by making equity an explicit component in the prioritization and delivery
  of both projects and services, just as equity is a critical framework of our transportation
  infrastructure. The moveDC planning process was inclusive, with participation from
  hundreds of residents and stakeholders from every ward of the District. Now, let’s
  moveDC together. Sincerely, Muriel Bowser, Mayor “moveDC reflects

  our commitment

  to not only

  provide excellent

  transportation

  facilities and

  services, but to

  deliver them

  in a manner

  that addresses

  structural injustices

  and inequities.” Mayor Muriel Bowser A Message From DDOT Director Everett Lott moveDC
  is our long-range transportation plan, built on a framework of goals: safety, equity,
  mobility, project delivery, management and operations, sustainability, and enjoyable
  spaces. The District Department of Transportation (DDOT) updated our long-range
  plan during an unprecedented health emergency that created challenges to connecting
  with District residents. However, it also highlighted opportunities for DDOT to
  proactively improve how we move people and goods, and to support our community and
  businesses by rethinking the use of public space. The moveDC strategies reflect
  what we learned. moveDC will make traveling in the District safer, cleaner, faster,
  and easier. We will support multimodal solutions that provide options for traveling.
  Safety remains our highest priority, and we are committed to achieving our Vision
  Zero goal of zero fatalities and serious injuries by 2024. Equity will be considered
  in everything we do — moveDC will ensure that our investments in transportation
  benefit all residents, visitors, and commuters. Please join with me as we moveDC.Sincerely,
  Everett Lott, Director “Equity will be considered in everything we do — moveDC will
  ensure our investments in transportation benefit all residents, visitors, and commuters.”
