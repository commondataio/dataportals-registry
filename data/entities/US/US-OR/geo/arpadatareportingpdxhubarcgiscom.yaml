  and signed by President Biden in March 2021. The Rescue Plan delivers direct relief
  to American families and businesses. It also provides direct relief to state, local,
  and territorial governments. As a large city, Portland received a grant of $208
  million through a part of the Rescue Plan called State and Local Fiscal Recovery
  Funds. The City received the first half of the grant funds (Round 1) in spring of
  2021, and the second half (Round 2) in the first six months of 2022. The American
  Rescue Plan: Investing in Portland program supports implementation of the funds
  to serve Portlanders impacted by COVID-19. Portland City Council invests funds in
