description: 'COVID-19 Georgia Geospatial Data Hub Geospatial data enables informed
  planning, policy development, decision making, and response, which function together
  to improve the overall safety and economic resilience of the State of Georgia and
  its citizens. The Georgia COVID-19 Geospatial Data Hub is an effort to disseminate
  publicly available data and information resources to decision-makers and the public
  that will be useful in managing this unprecedented crisis. There are many ways to
  interpret data. The hub contains content from a wide variety of sources from diverse
  perspectives. We hope you will find it useful! Walk Through Our Site With Dr. Schmidtke
  This Geospatial Data Hub was launched in May of 2020 for the purposes of providing
  COVID-19 information to the general public, but with a focus on geospatial professionals.
  We continue to add information as time and resources allow. We acknowledge that
  our audience has greatly expanded to include non-geospatial professionals, and we
  ask for your patience and understanding that we cannot meet every user''s needs.
  We continue to seek opportunities to innovate and meet these challenges, but we
  acknowledge that our page can''t meet everyone’s needs, all the time, and we apologize
  for that. We will keep working on it! Our colleague and Data Task Force teammate, Dr.
  Amber Schmidtke has created a fabulous walkthrough of our site and posted it on YouTube to
  assist those of you who are finding it challenging to explore and utilize this site.

  the hospital dashboards, provided by the Georgia Geospatial Information Office,
  will be sunset. This resource is being removed because the reporting requirements
  for hospitals are changing and the data provided through the hospital data feeds
  (which support the dashboards) will decline in accuracy. In lieu of this change,
  please see the Health and Human Safety (HHS) Dashboard which will be more accurate: https://public-data-hub-dhhs.hub.arcgis.com/.
  Maps for Planning COVID-19 Event Risk Assessment Planning Tool (source: Georgia
  Tech) COVID-19 Event Risk Assessment Planning Tool is an interactive dashboard that
  calculates county-level risk of attending an event with someone actively infected
  with the virus. The tool was created by several groups at Georgia Tech. Georgia
  Small Business Vulnerability StoryMap (source: Georgia GIO) This StoryMap is an
  analysis of Georgia small businesses and their vulnerability in response to the
  COVID-19 crisis. COVID-19 Regional Case Rates (source: Johns Hopkins) The feature
  layers in this map contain the most up-to-date COVID-19 cases for the southern United
  States (FEMA Region 4). Data pulled from the Coronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases by
  the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University,
  the Red Cross, the Census American Community Survey, and the Bureau of Labor and
  Statistics, and aggregated at the US county level. Maps for Social Distancing and
  Mobility The applications below showcase mobility data from industry leaders who
  have made their data public. Data is collected from cellular data and aggregated
  to the county or census block level. The apps can be used to explore how different
  areas of the state are adhering to social distancing recommendations by measuring
  where, when, and how often devices leave their "home." Maps for Businesses and Unemployment
  The applications below use a variety of public demographic and economic resources
  to explore the impact of COVID-19 on industry and economy. On the left is an application
  with monthly unemployment figures from the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Centered
  is an application highlighting an economic vulnerability index, which assigns a
  value to each county based on a variety of economic variables. The application on
  the right features predominant industry, by strength and size of the workforce,
  for the State of Georgia. Maps of Social Media The below application showcases public
  sentiment surrounding COVID-19. The data is aggregated from social media posts and
  classified into either positive, negative or neutral posts. Maps for Vulnerable
  Populations The below applications use demographic and economic indicators to measure
  and describe the vulnerability of jurisdictions in the state. Vulnerability is measured
  in terms of populations at risk of contracting COVID-19 itself, as well as economic
  impact from the response to the pandemic. Useful Resources Use the links below to
