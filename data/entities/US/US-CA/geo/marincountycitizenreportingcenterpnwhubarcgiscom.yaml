  do I provide feedback after the problem has been resolved? Does the Call Center
  handle emergency services? How do I report a bug in the Citizen Problem Reporter
  application? Yes, you can search for your problem report and check the status of
  your report at any time. No, you can remain anonymous when you submit a problem
