description: 'California Department of Conservation Open Data and Maps CNRA The Department
  of Conservation provides services and information that promote environmental health,
  economic vitality, informed land-use decisions, and sound management of our state’s
  natural resources. As home to the California Geological Survey, the Division of
  Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources, Division of Land Resource Protection, and Division
  of Mine Reclamation, spatial data informs virtually every aspect of the Department’s
  activities. The California Department of Conservation (DOC) is a prolific producer
  of spatial data and manages much of the data using Geographic Information Systems
  (GIS). More information can be found at DOC Maps, the California Department of Conservation''s
  Geospatial Data and Web Maps collection. Find Data Explore by Subject Area Land
