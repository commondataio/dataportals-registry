  \ primary responsibilities in fulfillment of federal and state requirements include\
  \ the development of the Regional Transportation Plan and Sustainable Communities\
  \ Strategy; the Federal Transportation Improvement Program; the annual Overall Work\

  \ and programs are in conformity with state air quality plans; periodic preparation\
  \ of a Regional Housing Needs Assessment; and intergovernmental review of regionally\
  \ significant development projects. SCAG regularly compiles and updates a number\
  \ of economic and demographic data resources on topics such as population, household,\
  \ and employment figures and projections; economic indices (Consumer Price Index,\
  \ Consumer Expenditure Survey, Cost of Living Index); firm size; exports and imports;\
  \ women and minority owned businesses; financial transactions; housing activity,\
  \ valuation, sales, and ownership; and agricultural production. Southern California\
  \ is a leading center for innovation, university research, and technology development,\
  \ all important aspects of building a sustainable region. As such, the region is\
  \ in a unique position to build a clean energy economy, with livable communities\
  \ and efficient buildings near clean transit. Go Human is a campaign that encourages\
  \ Southern Californians to use human-powered transportation and change how we think\
  \ about others on the road. Walk. Bike. Go Human. REVISION is a regional mapping\
  \ and analysis application that integrates a range of public and private data for\
  \ sustainable communities planning and trend visualization. About SCAG GIS Data\
