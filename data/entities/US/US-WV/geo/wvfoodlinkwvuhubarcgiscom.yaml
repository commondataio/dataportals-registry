description: WV FOODLINK is dedicated to improving access to affordable, nutritious,
  and sustainable, and culturally appropriate food in West Virginia and beyond. WV
  FOODLINK is a project of the Food Justice Lab housed in West Virginia University
  Center for Resilient Communities. In collaboration with our community partners,
  we have developed a resource hub and learning commons to support a people-centered,
  resilient food network in West Virginia. Our work is motivated by a vision that
  all people must have access to safe, nutritious, and culturally appropriate food
  in sufficient quantity and quality to sustain a healthy life with human dignity.
  Today, many West Virginians face critical challenges in meeting their basic nutritional
  needs. A variety of organizations work to address this issue from different angles
  from food charities to state government programs, social entrepreneurs and nutrition
  advocates to specialty crop producers. WV FOODLINK serves as an information center
  for these many different groups and is used by program directors, social workers,
  and policymakers. WV FOODLINK is currently supported by grants from Mazon and WVU
  Extension Family Nutrition Program (SNAP-Ed). Seed funding for WV FOODLINK came
  from a Public Service Award from West Virginia University in 2013 and the Benedum
  Foundation in 2014. WVU FOOD JUSTICE LAB CENTER FOR RESILIENT COMMUNITIES 309 Brooks
