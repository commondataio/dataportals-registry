description: Connecting the Mountain State with the IIJA and IRA “Welcome to the newly
  expanded West Virginia Infrastructure Hub. The recent federal infrastructure bills
  offer an opportunity to tackle long-standing West Virginia Infrastructure issues.
  Let's use this tool to work together, strategically apply for grant funds, and leave
  no stone unturned.” - Governor Jim Justice About the IIJA and IRA The Infrastructure
  Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) was signed into law on November 15, 2021. This legislation
  presents a significant opportunity for states and local governments to enhance various
  aspects of infrastructure. Through this law, improvements can be made in areas such
  as roads, bridges, public safety, public transportation, resilience measures, electric
  vehicle charging infrastructure, ports, rail systems, environmental remediation,
  clean water accessibility, internet connectivity, and job creation. The Inflation
  Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law on August 16, 2022. The IRA provides billions
  of dollars in incentives, grants, and loans, as well as tax credits programs to
  support new infrastructure investments in the areas of clean energy, transportation,
  and the environment. Calendar of Upcoming IIJA Funding Opportunities and Milestones
