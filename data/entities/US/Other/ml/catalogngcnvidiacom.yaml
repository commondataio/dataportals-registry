description: A curated set of GPU-optimized software for AI, HPC and Visualization.
  The content provided by NVIDIA and third-party ISVs simplifies building, customizing,
  and integrating GPU-optimized software into workflows, accelerating the time to
  solutions for users. The NGC Catalog consists of containers, pre-trained models,
  Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments, and industry-specific AI toolkits with software
  development kits (SDKs). Containers package software applications, libraries, dependencies,
  and run-time compilers in a self-contained environment to easily deploy them across
  various computing environments.
