description: The NSF NCAR Research Data Archive (RDA) contains a large and diverse
  collection of meteorological and oceanographic observations, and operational and
  reanalysis model outputs, integrated with NSF NCAR High Performance Compute resources
  to support atmospheric and geosciences research. The RDA is managed by the Data
  Engineering and Curation Section (DECS) of the Computational and Information Systems
  Laboratory (CISL) at the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF NCAR).
