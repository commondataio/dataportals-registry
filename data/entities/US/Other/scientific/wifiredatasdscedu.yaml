description: WIFIREâ€™s primary mission is to turn data and computing into a utility
  for advancing fire science. The principles behind the system are transparency and
  community collaboration. WIFIRE is built to enable and use any fire modeling software
  in combination with data at scale, and many are needed for use in different environments
  and hazards. This data catalog integrates and serves data from diverse providers,
  some of which fund WIFIRE to sustain the data catalog.
