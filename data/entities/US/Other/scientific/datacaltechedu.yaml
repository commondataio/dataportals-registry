description: The CaltechDATA repository offers standard data preservation and DOI
  (permanent identifier) services, enabling researchers to upload research data, link
  data with their publications, and assign a permanent DOI so that others can reference
  the data set. All data is preserved using the OAIS reference model, and multiple
  copies of all data sets are stored at the Caltech Library and remotely. CaltechDATA
  is intended as a long-term data repository and it is expected that data will be
  available for the foreseeable future. At a minimum, all data will be preserved by
  Caltech Library at least 5 years past the tenure of the grant. The repository is
  managed by Caltech Library and built on InvenioRDM.
