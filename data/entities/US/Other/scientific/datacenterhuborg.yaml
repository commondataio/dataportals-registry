description: Historical repository of collections of files once housed at datacenterhub
  (without the interactive tools that were available on that site). Originally established
  at Purdue University in 2014 to preserve data and digital infrastructure available
  after the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) was terminated by
  NSF. Now maintained by University of Canterbury, New Zealand.
