description: The U.S. Antarctic Program Data Center (USAP-DC) supports investigators
  funded by the National Science Foundation in documenting, preserving, and disseminating
  their research results. It provides a central USAP Project Catalog for all projects
  funded by the NSF Antarctic program and a Data Repository for research datasets
  derived from these projects. Data include NSF research-related glaciology data.
  Datasets are registered in the Antarctic Metadata Directory to comply with the Antarctic
  Treaty and to represent the U.S. in Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR)
  activities.
