description: A data exploration tool with a public web interface for discovering and
  accessing public data from the Southeast Coastal Ocean Observing Regional Association,
  supporting scientists, managers, and the general public. It integrates datasets
  from many sources including real-time conditions, operational and research forecasts,
  satellite observations, and spatially referenced datasets describing biological,
  chemical, and physical characteristics. Advanced features include interactive mapping,
  charting, comparisons, time binning, and climatology/anomaly plotting. Users can
  create, share, and download custom compilations of sensor and model outputs.
