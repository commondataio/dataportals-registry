description: Over the years, IFDC has conducted numerous research and demonstration
  trials across its global programs and projects. Looking to avoid poor documentation,
  loss of data, and to boost the efficiency of data usage and decision-making abilities,
  IFDC has implemented a center-wide initiative to collect all research and development
  data in standard accessible formats, collate all data and analyses, and to make
  it available through IFDC solutions. The Dataverse came to corroborate with the
  IFDC idea to implement the FAIR principles and make the data easily findable, accessible,
  interoperable, and reusable.
