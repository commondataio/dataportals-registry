description: We provide data management support for UI researchers and their regional,
  national, and international collaborators. This support keeps researchers at the
  cutting-edge of science and increases our institution's competitiveness for external
  research grants. Quality data and metadata developed in research projects and curated
  by RCDS (formerly NKN) is a valuable, long-term asset upon which to develop and
  build new research and science.
