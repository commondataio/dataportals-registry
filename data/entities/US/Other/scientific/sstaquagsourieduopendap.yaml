description: OPeNDAP Hyrax (1.17.0-1) server hosted by the URI Graduate School of
  Oceanography, providing access to sea surface temperature (SST) datasets from satellite
  observations including the JAXA_Orbits, RSS_Orbits, SST_Orbits, and gradients_by_period
  collections. The catalog exposes SST measurements, gradients, and related oceanographic
  datasets via the OPeNDAP Data Access Protocol for browser previews or DAP2/DAP4
  downloads.
