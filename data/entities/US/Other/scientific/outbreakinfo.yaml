description: In response to the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes
  COVID-19), researchers worldwide have been generating and openly sharing data, publications,
  reagents, code, protocols, and more. Broad sharing of these resources improves the
  speed and efficiency of science. Unfortunately, there are no uniform standards and
  repositories for collecting all this information in one place.
