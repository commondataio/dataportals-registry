description: 'Welcome to the Global Fistula Hub Obstetric fistula is a devastating
  childbirth injury that leaves women incontinent and isolated. The Global Fistula
  Hub features fistula related knowledge products; maps, data visualizations, open
  data, and upcoming industry events.  The aim of this platform is to share and spread
  knowledge of obstetric fistula repair and prevention - to remove the threat of fistula
  once and for all. Updated UN Guidance, Obstetric Fistula &amp; Other Forms of Female
  Genital Fistula: Guiding Principles for Clinical Management and Programme Development, is
  here! UNFPA &amp; the Campaign to End Fistula are delighted to

  announce the new edition of the global UN guidance, Obstetric fistula&amp; other
  forms of female genital fistula: Guiding principles for clinical management and
  programme development. The so-called “orange manual” has

  long been the only authoritative, gold-standard guide to the holistic,

  comprehensive and “bigger picture” aspects of eliminating obstetric fistula

  (including programming, policy, prevention, treatment, social reintegration and

  more). The original (2006) version of the manual has now been updated with the

  latest evidence, strategies, tools and resources. The manual embodies the global/UN
  vision of the new way

  forward and paradigm shift as we move toward eradicating fistula by 2030, as per

  the UN

  General Assembly Resolution (2018 &amp; 2020) and the UN

  Secretary General’s Report (2020) on intensifying efforts to end

  obstetric fistula within a decade. If we are to accomplish this visionary,

  ambitious goal, new approaches &amp; strategies are required, based on current

  evidence, best practices and lessons learnt in the decade plus since the

  original edition of this manual was issued. Given the urgency of ending obstetric
  fistula as a critical

  step towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and realizing

  the promise of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action as well as the

  Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and

  Development, this manual serves as a crucial resource and a guiding light on

  the path to achieving health, gender equality and human rights for all. Click here
  to access the updated UN Guidance Unpacking the Orange Manual: The Updated Guidance
  on Fistula Repair On September 20, 2021, UNFPA, the Campaign to End Fistula, and
  Direct Relief held a webinar discussing the updated Orange Manual, highlighting
  new paradigms in prevention, programming, and care. The webinar featured Dr. Steve
  Arrowsmith (Direct Relief), interviewed by Erin Anastasi (UNFPA, Campaign to End
  Fistula) on the updated UN guidance, followed by a brief overview of the Global
  Fistula Hub by Jessica White (Direct Relief). Read the article, "Innovation, Creativity
  Required to End Fistula Globally by 2030" on Direct Relief''s Newsfeed, and access

  Explore Data Find Events Find Organizations Connect &amp; Collaborate The Annual
  Fistula Repair Survey Since 2010, the Annual Fistula Repair Survey seeks to understand
  where obstetric fistula repairs are happening around the world. Data collected from
  the annual repair survey on fistula repair facility information is used to create
  the data visualizations on the Global Fistula Hub and is available for download
  in the open data portal.Not all fistula repair facilities are displayed on the “Find
  a Fistula Repair Facility” data visualization. To be displayed on the map, a fistula
  repair facility needs to perform 25 or more repairs a year, have practices in alignment
  with UNFPA''s guiding principles, and have submitted survey data within the last
  5 years. Data for all fistula repair facilities, including those that do not meet
  the above criteria for display, can be downloaded in the Open Data Portal. The goal
  of this knowledge is to improve the understanding of available services, to better
  direct distributions of resources, and to identify and address service gaps. Fistula_Repair_Data_for_Maps_and_Apps

  to efforts to end

  obstetric fistula, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 and to commit

  themselves to continued efforts to improve maternal and newborn health, with

  the aim of eliminating obstetric fistula globally within a decade. - UN 55th plenary
  meeting 17 December 2018 Obstetric Fistula Related Data and Resources Explore and
  download publicly available data related to obstetric fistula. Data is thematically
  organized by Sustainable Development Goals where possible, as progress in these
  goals is progress in the eradication of obstetric fistula. Check back often as additional
  datasets will be added, and suggest other datasets to be hosted! No Poverty - Sustainable

  Resources Direct Relief was founded in 1948 with the mission to improve health access
  globally.  Direct Relief has several programs focusing on Maternal Child Health
  (MCH) Issues as health mothers and healthy babies are the bedrock of any community.
  MCH programs are supported through the collation and sharing of related data, as
  seen in this project, and through the supply of product, as seen with the Fistula
  Repair Modules. "We have to think more about sustainability on fistula care being
  provided by local resources rather than international inputs. Moving away from a
  camp model of care, where outsiders come in for repairs, towards a model where locals
  are providing services. In many locations, the number is going down, in other areas
  fistulas remain a sizeable public health issue. Targetting this requires a geographic
  approach, as some areas need more surgeons and more facililties, while some areas
  need consolidations so that fistula surgeons can remain competent and skilled despite
  the smaller number of patients. Because of the geographically heterogeneous nature
  of the problem, the global fistula map is an important tool to strategically deploy
  services in a time of changing need." - Dr. Steve Arrowsmith About The aim of the
  Global Fistula Hub is to provide a community resource that provides data and other
  knowledge products to remove the threat of fistula for every woman, everywhere.
