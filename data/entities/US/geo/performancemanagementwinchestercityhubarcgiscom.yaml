  Questions Common questions you may be asking about the Community Performance Portal.
  What is the Community Performance Portal? How is performance being measured? Can
  I see how my neighborhood is performing? How often are the performance metrics and
  dashboards updated? The Community Performance Portal is a destination for the community
  that provides a snap shot of key performance indicators. Key performance indicators
  are organized around strategic outcomes identified by the community during a series
  of planning sessions. The Performance Management Office collects community wide
  data to monitor performance, improve service delivery, promote transparency, drive
  innovation, and creatively solve problems. In addition to promoting data-driven
  decision making, our community created the Community Performance Portal. This interactive
  portal can be used by government agencies to monitor key performance metrics and
  communicate progress made on strategic outcomes to the general public and other
  interested stakeholders. Each dashboard on the Community Performance Portal allows
  users to visualize performance for the entire community and focus in to a location
  within the community, like a neighborhood, council district, or service area. Right
  now, many of our measures are being reported annually. Some of the measures do have
  the capacity to be refreshed more often and the update frequency for those may be
  weekly or monthly. Update frequencies for each data set are reviewed each year by
  the Performance Management Office and as data becomes more accessible to our community.

  in local events that help us achieve our community goals.
