  Projects SPC Staff is constantly collecting and updating data for a wide array of
  projects within the region. Below are a few projects we’re working on here at SPC.
  Allegheny County Connected Infrastructure How connected is the pedestrian infrastructure
  in Allegheny County?  This project uses colorful symbology to answer that question. 
  Each connected infrastructure cluster has its own color, making it easy to see where
  sidewalk connections are most needed. Allegheny County Pedestrian Network This web
  app displays sidewalks, steps, crosswalks, and connecting trails in Allegheny County
  that make up the pedestrian network. To download this data for Allegheny County
  and other counties, type "sidewalks" into the search bar above. Trail and Bicycle
  Infrastructure Looking for a new bike trail to try out? Wondering where the bike
  lanes or bike racks are in your area? This web app displays our region''s comprehensive
  trail and bicycle network, as well as the accompanying facilities. Level of Comfort
  Mapping (In Progress) This map shows the "level of comfort" for on-street bicycling
  in the SPC region. This project is still in development, as we are consistently
  adding more roads from all 10 SPC counties to our LOC network. Check out these GIS
  applications created by SPC staff to showcase our work at the agency. Get Involved
