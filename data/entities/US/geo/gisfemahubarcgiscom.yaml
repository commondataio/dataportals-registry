description: "FEMA Geospatial Resource Center FEMA GIS supports the emergency management\
  \ community with world-class geospatial information, services, and technologies\
  \ to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from and mitigate against\
  \ all hazards. During activations we will use the Coordination Call page to coordinate\
  \ GIS response activities. View incident-specific resources on the \"Incident Pages\
  \ and Data\" page. Explore Hazard Specific Resources USA Structures Data Screenshot\
  \ of USA Structures Data USA Structures Dataset The USA Structures database, which\
  \ is now available as a feature service via the esri Living Atlas, is an inventory\
  \ of all structures\n                    larger than 450 square feet for use in\
  \ Flood Insurance Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness and\n                  \
  \  Response. The data contains the location of residential and non-residential structures\
  \ and uses a\n                    Universal Unique Identifier (UUID),Â  which is\
  \ a unique ID for each structure across the entire dataset. This\n             \
  \       new capability will increase our understanding of the types of buildings\
  \ attributed to specific\n                    locations, improve the quality and\
  \ traceability of data related to buildings at risk, make building\n           \
  \         data more consistent and reusable across projects, and create a shared\
  \ baseline between various\n                    programmatic stakeholders. Explore\

  \ - please check back soon What is the Geospatial Resource Center? Before, during\
  \ and after disasters, decision-makers at the federal, state, and local level need\
  \ access to data. FEMA created this site to enable users to share, and access disaster\
  \ response data, maps and applications in a secure environment. Our goal is to make\
  \ content provided by us and our governmental, private sector and volunteer agency\
  \ partners, including HHS, Census, NASA, and many others, easy to retrieve, and\
  \ visible to everyone. \nThe site includes pages for seven different disaster types,\
  \ and one for less common events. It also includes data and applications, such as\
  \ aerial or other remotely sensed imagery, from historic events. Category galleries\
  \ provide the ability to sort the content so you can easily find the information\
  \ you need. Join the Community Please join the geospatial response community. During\
  \ disaster events, we provide emailed updates and hold coordination calls with the\
  \ impacted state and community geospatial personnel. Visit our Community page to\
  \ learn more about how to access and share geospatial resources with FEMA."
