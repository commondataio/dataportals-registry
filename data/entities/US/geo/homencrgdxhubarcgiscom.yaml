  \ local, regional, state, and federal participants in the National Capital Region\
  \ (Maryland-Virginia-DC) to share critical information among emergency management\
  \ systems. Through the NCR GDX, participating jurisdictions have the opportunity\
  \ to link GIS and emergency management personnel and data through a shared commitment\
  \ to break down technical communication barriers. Results from the search bar will\
  \ be limited to content you have access to per AGOL permissions. Only members of\
  \ the groups below will be able to view related sensitive data. Non-member users\
  \ can still navigate to each page to learn more about the Key Initiatives. Interested\
