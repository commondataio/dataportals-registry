description: San Bernardino County Food Sustainability and Accessibility Department
  of Public Health Nutrition Program The Department of Public Health (DPH) is committed
  to improving the overall wellness and quality of life in San Bernardino County.  The
  DPH Strategic Plan identifies opportunities for aligning the Departmentâ€™s work with
  Communities Vital Signs to transform San Bernardino County into a healthier place
  to live, work, learn, play, and worship.  Consequently, many of the goals and objectives
  within the plan are related to increasing access to healthy foods to address food
  insecurity and prevent obesity The Food Accessibility map serves as a tool to provide
  data and mapping resources for decision-making that can ultimately lead to improved
  food access.  Food accessibility ensures that sources for healthy food are easy
  to get to at a manageable distance from home, school, or work, using affordable
  and convenient personal (which includes walking) or public transportation. Food
