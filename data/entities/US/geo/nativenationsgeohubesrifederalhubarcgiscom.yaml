description: Our shared vision is to create an international GeoHub for the Esri Native
  Nations community, which provides access to data, apps, tools, and capacity building.
  We aim to ensure data availability at various levels (national, departmental, and
  local) by systematically and regularly collecting authoritative and crowd-sourced
  data through the Living Atlas. Explore the Native Nations GeoHub
