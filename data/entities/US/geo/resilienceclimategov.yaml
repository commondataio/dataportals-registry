description: "Climate Mapping forResilience and Adaptation Knowing which hazards could\
  \ harm the things you care about is the first step in protecting them. This portal\
  \ can help you understand what climate-related hazards you face, now and in the\
  \ future. Climate-related hazards in real-time Climate-related hazards are affecting\
  \ U.S. communities every day. View real-time statistics and maps documenting where\
  \ people, property, and infrastructure may be exposed to hazards. Click any hazard\
  \ below to display its associated map. Click areas of interest on any map for more\
  \ information. Does your community face any of these hazards, now or in the future?\
  \ The impacts of climate-related hazards are already occurring, and they are projected\
  \ to worsen in many regions. Launch the CMRA Assessment tool below and enter your\
  \ location to see how climate conditions are projected to change through this century.\
  \ CMRA Assessment Tool Check how climate conditions in your location are projected\
  \ to change over the next several decades. Explore the results to recognize if the\
  \ things your community values—assets such as people, property, and infrastructure—could\
  \ be exposed to climate-related hazards. Click the image to open CMRA Assessment\

  \ Flooding Coastal Inundation Implementing climate resilience policy The Federal\
  \ government is taking action to protect people, property, and infrastructure from\
  \ the impacts of changing climate conditions across the country. Federal agencies\
  \ are providing access to improved datasets, new tools, and guidance to help people\

  \ exposure to climate-related hazards. The curated collections below offer Federal\
  \ and non-federal resources; most of the open datasets are ready for use in a range\
  \ of geospatial software. For assistance in using mapping technologies to assess\
  \ your situation and build climate resilience, view tutorials in Esri's GIS for\
