  \ Map Inventory Adopt-A-Street Tree in Cincinnati Calhoun St. WHAT IS A STREET TREE?\
  \ WHAT does it mean to adopt a street tree? A “street tree” is any tree planted\
  \ by or on behalf of the City in the street Right-Of-Way. Typically trees are planted\
  \ in\nthe “park strip” which is the area between the sidewalk and the street.\n\
  Sometimes, when the sidewalk is adjacent to the curb, (known as a “monolithic sidewalk”)\
  \ the tree is planted next to\nthe sidewalk. If a tree is not within the public\
  \ right-of-way, it is NOT a street tree. This hub allows people interested in volunteering\
  \ to care for Cincinnati's urban tree street network by adopting one or multiple\
  \ street trees. As an adopter you will periodically check on your street tree to\
  \ monitor health, clean up trash in and around the tree well, water the street tree\
  \ if necessary, and possibly participate in mulching and other beautification efforts.\
  \ A network of volunteers will help the Cincinnati Parks Urban Forestry program\
  \ with the monitoring and care of our street tree network. This website also allows\
  \ and encourages you as a citizen to be more active in walking and and engaging\
  \ with your community. Jane Jacobs wrote about \"eyes on the street\" in her famous\
  \ quote \"there must be eyes upon the street, \neyes belonging to those we might\
  \ call the natural proprietors of the \nstreet\" and through this network of volunteers\
  \ we will increase the number of \"eyes on the street\" trees. Features on this\
  \ website enable you to coordinate with other volunteers, report hours volunteered,\
  \ report issues, create events for community wide events, and read about other volunteers.\
