  \ areas, which include Invest in Infrastructure, Continue the Commitment to Public\
  \ Safety, Continue the Commitment to Developing Neighborhoods, Strategically Invest\
  \ in Quality of Life, Improve Fiscal Sustainability, and Improve Performance and\
  \ Cost-Effectiveness. The measures that are included on the portal are a portion\
  \ of measures that have been highlighted for the current period. Strategic initiatives\
  \ in the city budget create a culture for standards and processes to pursue excellence\
  \ in reporting and transparency. The city strives to create a service oriented culture\
  \ in government by using data and information to proactively make decisions. City\

  \ What Works Cities, a Bloomberg Philanthropies' initiative, partners with local\
  \ governments to enhance their use of data and evidence to improve people's lives.\
  \ An Independent assessment of Topeka's street network in early fall 2016 gave us\
  \ an average grade (Pavement Condition Index or PCI) of 55 on a scale of 100. \n\
  \ Topeka's grade means our roads are right on the border between fair and poor -\
  \ and we have some decisions to make. From the Interim City Manager's desk, weekly\
  \ reports contain updates from across the City's Departments and Divisions about\
  \ past activity and upcoming events.  Click here to view the reports on the City's\
  \ website!"
