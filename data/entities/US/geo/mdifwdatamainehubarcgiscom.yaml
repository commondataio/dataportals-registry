  Engage, Collaborate Welcome to the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife
  Data Hub Explore and engage with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data, discover
  apps, and collaborate on projects. Your participation in data collection is a valuable
  contribution to managing Maine''s fisheries and wildlife populations. We need YOUR
  help to achieve our goals! Biologists. Game wardens. Educators. And YOU - the hunters,
  fishermen, and everyday adventurers who support our work. For recreation, for hunting,
  for fishing, for science, or just for fun: we''re all in for the Maine outdoors.
  GIS IN THE SPOTLIGHT Discover the remarkable recovery story of Maine''s Bald Eagle
  population after it was nearly lost in the 1960s. Maine citizens enthusiastically
  supported recover efforts and became part of the solution - not just bringing the
  eagle back "from the brink", but also safeguarding bald eagle habitat into the future
  through land donations, bargain sales, conservation easements, and cooperative agreements. 
  This is the story a new MDIFW map application endeavors to tell, in a fun and interactive
  way! The Bald Eagle Story Map tells the remarkable story of the eagle''s recover
  in Maine and how it was accomplished, with fun anecdotes along the way including
  Maine''s oldest eagle, eagle nests with triplets and even quadruplets (!), Maine''s
  larges eagle nest, and the story of an eagle who liked to wander far from home (over
  980 miles!). Explore Data by Category Significant Wildlife Habitat (SWH) Natural

  mapped fish and wildlife resources on your land?  Are you working on a conservation,
  comprehensive, or open space plan for your land trust, conservation commission,
  or town? Are you curious about how wildlife habitats connect throughout your town
  or region? Beginning with Habitat is a non-regulatory program housed at MDIFW that
  compiles the best available natural resource data from multiple sources for conserving
  fisheries, wildlife, and plant habitats on a landscape scale.  We are the longest-running
  partnership of it''s kind in the Northeast U.S., comprised of state and federal
  agencies, conservation organizations, and landowner representatives. We offer customized
  mapping services and technical assistance to help you or your organization bring
  natural resource information into your own plans.  Our website beginningwithhabitat.org
  offers additional planning resources, links, and PDF maps to help you meet your
  goals.  We can also help identify ways your project supports Maine''s Wildlife Action
  Plan, our State''s comprehensive plan for conserving at-risk fish and wildlife.

  Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife''s environmental review (ER) program
  provides resource

  information and recommendations pursuant to the regulatory programs of the

  Maine Department of Environmental Protection and the Maine Land Use

  Planning Commission.  Our primary

  concerns involve Threatened, Endangered and Special concern species and habitats;

  Essential Habitats; Significant Wildlife Habitats; and Protected Natural

  Resources.  MDIFW ER staff work with

  applicants, consultants, and regulators to identify ways to avoid or minimize

  significant adverse impacts to wildlife, fisheries, and critical habitats to

  the extent practicable.  And, when

  possible, we look for opportunities to mitigate or offset such impacts. Visit our
  website for more information about the Environmental Review program. Maybe you''re
  just curious and want to see for yourself which important habitats occur near your
  project area. Check out the Habitat Data Viewer click on the app below to open the

  The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife tracks where many of Maine''s
  priority wildlife species occur.  Keeping our databases current is challenging,
  especially for species that are uncommon, cryptic, or that live in remote areas.
