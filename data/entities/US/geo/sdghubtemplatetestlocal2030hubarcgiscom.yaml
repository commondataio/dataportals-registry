description: 'Palau SDG Hub Tracking our local progress towards the UN Sustainable
  Development Goals. For information on how to get involved, please contact Charlene
  Mersai, National Environment Coordinator :  charmersai@gmail.com Palau actively
  participated in formulating the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and has
  played a leadership role - globally and locally - in safeguarding the environment
  for future generations. Other national goals include access to quality health care
  and education, reduction of poverty amidst a growing economy, a sustainably financed
  nationwide network of protected areas, and enduring regional and global partnerships.
  Nonetheless, challenges remain due to vulnerabilities as a small island developing
  state, global economic forces, and climate change SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities Before
  the pandemic hit, modest gains had been made in reducing inequality in some areas,
  for instance, reducing income inequality in some countries, continuing preferential
  trade status to lower-income countries, and reducing transaction costs of remittances.
  However, inequality persists in its various forms, whether income, wealth, opportunities
  or other dimensions. The COVID-19 pandemic is now exacerbating existing inequalities
  within and among countries and hitting the most vulnerable people and the poorest
  countries hardest and is projected to push back the poorest countries a full 10
  years on their SDG progress. Globally, refugees were at the highest absolute number
  on record in 2020. Even amidst strict COVID-19 mobility restrictions across the
  globe, thousands of migrants died along the migratory journey. Lorem ipsum dolor
