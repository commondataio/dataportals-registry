description: 'ALERT: On July 26, 2023, RIDOH issued a public health advisory due to
  increased drug overdose activity in Woonsocket. Please share this alert with your
  networks. *Note: The graphics displayed on this webpage work best with Google Chrome
  and may not display properly in other web browsers. Overdose Fatalities RIDOH uses
  two sources of fatal overdose data for surveillance and analysis of drug overdose
  deaths in Rhode Island: OSME data track the occurrence of accidental drug overdose
  deaths for individuals who are pronounced dead in Rhode Island; these data are reported
  on a weekly basis. RIDOH reports on drug overdose deaths whereby the manner of death
  is “Accident” and does not include other manners such as suicides, homicides, or
  undetermined deaths. It can take up to 90 days for the OSME to confirm a decedent’s
  cause and manner of death. OSME Data: General Limitations Rhode Island residents
  who died of an accidental drug overdose outside of Rhode Island are not included
  SUDORS data capture detailed information about a person''s fatal overdose including
  toxicology reports, death scene investigations, route of administration, circumstances,
  and other risk factors. SUDORS data are most helpful for understanding factors and
  circumstances contributing to a person''s fatal overdose. RIDOH reports on drug
  overdose deaths whereby the manner of death is listed as “Accident” or “Undetermined.”
  SUDORS Data: General Limitations SUDORS data do not capture information on overdose
  fatalities noted as suicides or homicides on victims’ death certificate. This Data
  Hub adheres to RIDOH''s Small Numbers Reporting Policy to ensure the confidentiality
  of individual identities.  Data are suppressed when counts are fewer than five.
  Any future use of counts to construct proportions, rates, and other statistics is
  subject to reliability and confidentiality verifications. Please do not attempt
  to ascertain small numbers not displayed. View OSME Data Visualizations View SUDORS
