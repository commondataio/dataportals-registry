description: "Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area Tree Canopy Assessment The Oklahoma\
  \ City Metropolitan Area Tree Canopy Assessment is the first of its kind conducted\
  \ within a 536 square mile study area in Central Oklahoma. This assessment was conducted\
  \ during the spring and summer of 2019. Part of the assessment included using high\
  \ resolution satellite imagery to provide a birds-eye view of the entire forest\
  \ within the study area showing the land cover type and distribution of existing tree\
  \ canopy. Along with the land cover assessment, a planting priority analysis was\
  \ conducted to provide guidance and recommendations for future plantings to help\
  \ mitigate the impacts of urban heat islands and stormwater runoff. Web Maps Tree\
