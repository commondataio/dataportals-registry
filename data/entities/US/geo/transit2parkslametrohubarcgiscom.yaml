description: 'Metro envisions a Los Angeles in which people can use a network of varied
  and connected transportation options to get to their neighborhood parks, regional
  open space destinations and different park types. A future where people can not
  only access these green places, but also feel comfortable using them – people of
  all ages, genders, races, incomes, and abilities taking transit to parks and open
  spaces at different times of the week and of the year. Transit to Parks Strategic
  Plan Executive Summary Metro’s Transit to Parks Strategic Plan presents a systematic
  vision for increasing access to parks and open space countywide. The goal is to
  find targeted, holistic ways to increase access to parks and open spaces, especially
  for communities of need. These communities, especially those that are not within
  walking distance or without convenient public transit to a park, are the focus of
  the Plan. Expanding access is a key priority for the region as demonstrated in the
  Los Angeles Countywide Comprehensive Parks &amp; Recreation Needs Assessment and
  the Southern California Association of Governments’ Regional Transportation Plan,
  both of which highlight a lack of park and open space access. LA County has a wealth
  of open space and recreational assets, but often these places are out of reach for
  County residents, particularly lower income, disadvantaged communities. Metro is
  committed to initiating partnerships and finding ways to increase access to parks
  and open spaces for LA County. Transit to Parks Strategic Plan Transit to Parks
