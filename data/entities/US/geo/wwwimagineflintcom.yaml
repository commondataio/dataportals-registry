  \ Plan Adopted! Master Plan Adopted! Welcome to Imagine Flint, a site dedicated\
  \ to engaging, updating and informing you on the implementation of the Master Plan.\
  \ Work continues on a variety of planning, policy and project implementation processes.\
  \ The Flint Planning Commission approved a draft zoning code that aligns with the\
  \ Imagine Flint's\n future land use plan and the ordinance now heads to Flint City\
  \ Council \nfor adoption. The Flint Planning Commission also recently adopted an\
  \ updated 5-year Capital Improvements Plan and has work across multiple City departments\
  \ to develop Rebuild Flint the Right Way, an infrastructure guide for responding\
  \ to the Flint Water Crisis that integrates the policies of the Imagine Flint plan.\
  \ Additionally, the City launched the Imagine Flint Neighborhood Planning Initiative\n\
  \ in 2016 that works with neighborhood groups to develop actionable plans with specific\
  \ projects, ultimately producing a direction for neighborhood enhancement. To learn\
  \ more about the work occurring in the City's Planning &amp; \nZoning office, contact\
  \ us via email at masterplaninfo@cityofflint.com. Go the Interactive Plan to view\
  \ the plan's story map or go to the Resources page to download the Master Plan PDFs.\

  \ served as the foundation for the Imagine Flint planning\n process. Over 5,000\
  \ Flint residents and roughly 6,000 community members\n attended one of over 300\
  \ master plan events. Some key highlights of Imagine Flint outreach are below: You\
