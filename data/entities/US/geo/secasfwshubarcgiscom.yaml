  to inform conservation in the Southeast and Caribbean. Here, you can view and download
  data layers and create your own maps. In addition to the Southeast Conservation
  Blueprint, you'll find the underlying natural and cultural resource indicators,
  a regional connectivity analysis, and other data like sea-level rise, urbanization,
  protected lands, and more. Discover the Southeast Conservation Blueprint View Blueprint

  Agencies. Midwest Landscape Initiative Nature's Network Crucial Habitat Assessment
  Tool The Midwest Landscape Initiative (MLI) is a collaboration of fish and wildlife
  organizations that identifies shared conservation priorities to develop solutions
  for healthy, functioning ecosystems in the Midwest. It began in 2018 as a partnership
  between Midwest Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies member states, the U.S.
  Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Geological Survey to identify shared landscape-scale
  conservation priorities and to work with others to develop and implement effective
  conservation solutions. Nature’s Network is a collaborative effort facilitated by
  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Science Applications program that brings together
  partners from 13 states, federal agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and universities
  to identify the best opportunities for conserving and connecting intact habitats
  and ecosystems and supporting imperiled species to help ensure the future of fish
  and wildlife across the Northeast region. It is supported by the Northeast Association
  of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. The Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies
  Crucial Habitat Assessment Tool (CHAT) was developed to bring greater certainty
  and predictability to planning efforts by establishing a common starting point for
  discussing the intersection of development and wildlife. CHAT is a non-regulatory
  tool designed to reduce conflicts and surprises while ensuring wildlife values are
  better incorporated into land use planning, particularly for large-scale linear
  projects. Contact us secassoutheast.org/staff Do you have a question about the Blueprint?
