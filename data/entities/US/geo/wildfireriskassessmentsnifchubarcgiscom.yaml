description: 'NPS Wildfire Risk Assessments A consistent method that has been applied
  to NPS units nationwide regardless of variations in climate, fuels, and topography.
  The goals for the assessment effort are to: Gallery - Interact with the Data Using
  Customized Applications NPS Wildfire Risk Assessment Viewer This application allows
  users to view the Wildfire Risk Assessment dataset, including a summary of attributes
  and all photos associated with facilities. This is a publicly accessible application
  intended to be viewed in a web browser. NPS Structure Priority Dashboard NPS Wildfire
  Risk Assessments for Field Maps NPS Wildfire Risk Assessments  Web Editing App View
  the outcome of an agency wide effort to prioritize NPS facilities for defensible
  space treatments (Desired Outcome 2A of the Wildland Fire Strategic Plan - Fire
  (U.S. National Park Service) (nps.gov).  For more information, please click here.
  This is a publicly accessible application intended to be viewed in a web browser.
  Create, view and update the Wildfire Risk Assessment dataset.  Users who need to
  collect incident or treatment data in addition to assessment data, should use the
  NPS Incident Operations or the NPS Fuels Treatment Operations Maps for Field Maps.
  This application is intended to be used in Field Maps on a Mobile Device. This application
  allows users to create, view and update the Wildfire Risk Assessment dataset. Membership
  in the NPS Mobile Editors group is required for access.  This application is intended
  to be opened in a web browser. NPS Wildfire Risk Assessment Form - Determine Fire
  Hazard Field crews use the criteria below to evaluate access, surrounding environment,
  construction design and materials, and resources available to protect facilities
  from wildland fire. the sum of all values is equal to the score and used to determine
  the assessment rating.  The resulting rating characterizes the structure''s risk
  of ignition during a wildland fire. The form below is based on  Firewise® assessment
  forms. Recommendations to Create Defensible Space Maintenance of defensible space
  includes modifying or removing non-fire-resistant vegetation and keeping needles,
  leaves, and other dead vegetative material regularly removed from around structures
  and roofs. The code stipulates that: The need for additional clearance should be
  determined by the park structural fire coordinator, fuels manager, fire management
  officer, chief ranger, or park superintendent. The guidelines to the right, based
  on the IWUIC, Firewise recommendation and the state of California''s Code Regulations
  for Fire Hazard Reduction around Buildings and Structures were provided to field
  crews to facilitate recommendations for creating defensible space around structures.
  Firewood should be moved at least 50 ft from the facility and 15 horizontal feet
  from tree canopies Flammable ground cover such as leaf litter, woody debris or highly
  flammable vegetation should be removed Clear decks, above and below, of vegetative
  debris Limb trees 6 to 15 feet above ground Open crown spacing 10 to 30 feet depending
  on slope (see chart below) Clear adjacent and overhanging fuels to create 10 feet
  spacing between canopy and structure or chimney openings Remove dead or dying component
  of shrubs and trees Mow grass to less than 4 inches Firewise Zone 2 (30ft to 100ft
  from structure) Open crown spacing 10 to 30 feet depending on slope (see chart below)
  Flammable ground cover should be removed or isolated Firewise Zone 3 (100ft  to
  200ft from structure) NPS Fuels Treatment Prioritization Why Prioritize NPS Structures?
  National Park Service (NPS) owned structures represent a significant investment
  of taxpayer dollars and many have invaluable historic qualities. The NPS has an
  existing enterprise spatial database storing authoritative, readily accessible wildfire
  risk assessment data which can be used to make informed wildland fire management
  decisions, including how the agency can reduce risk to NPS structures using fuels
  treatments. Prioritizing this service wide workload will inform the allocation of
  fuels funds at regional and park levels to support defensible space around structures
  and help reduce unwanted losses from wildfires. The HIP Value The HIP value was
  originally created to prioritize NPS structures service wide for fuels treatments.
  Data from multiple authoritative sources is used to calculate a value for each NPS
  structure. The value represents the structure''s risk from wildland fire, it''s
  monetary value to the NPS as well as its contribution to the mission of the NPS,
  and the probability of a fire impacting the structure. This number is compared to
  all other NPS structures agency wide and the structure is given a priority rank. It
  is important to note, the only component of the HIP value that can be influenced
  by fuels treatments is the Hazard (score from wildfire risk assessment). The tHIP
  ValueThe tHIP value was developed in an attempt to identify which structures within
  the NPS Structure Prioritization are "treatable". The Wildland Fire Risk Assessment
  process evaluates multiple elements to produce a structure''s risk assessment score.
  Some elements, such as accessibility and building construction materials, cannot
  be mitigated through fuels treatments. The tHIP calculation will look at the elements
  of the Risk Assessment that can be reduced by implementing fuels treatments and
  highlight the structures where fuels treatments can provide a benefit. *Because
  the minimum value of the sum of the Fuel Load and Defensible space elements in the
  assessment is 1 (instead of 0) we can''t just divide by 38 (the max score). We need
  to subtract the min (1) and then divide by 37 (max-min), which will result in a
  true percentage. If we treat a structure (fuel load moves to ''Low'' and defensible
  space is ''Greater than 100 feet''), the Treatability will then drop to 0 resulting
  in a tHIP of 0 and the structure will fall off the prioritization list. Otherwise,
  for example, the Old Faithful in at Yellowstone National Park will always out-rank
  quite a few structures because of its high importance and probability if there remains
  a little treatability benefit (tHIP &gt;0), even after we have done everything we
  can around the structure. Adjusting the Treatability score to make it a true percentage
  will fix that- so once we have fully treated a structure it will result in tHIP
