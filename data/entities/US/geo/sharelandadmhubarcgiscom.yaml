description: 'Share Open access to your authoritative data within your organization
  and for the public. Cadastral data is the core of a NSDI. Share your data with other
  agencies that can benefit. Explore all of the different ways you can share your
  data with ArcGIS below. ArcGIS Hub The site you''ve been navigating (and this site!)
  have been entirely configured without code using ArcGIS Hub. The Hub concept is
  simple: create initiatives around things that are important to you (in this case,
  we wanted to share how Esri supports cadastre), organize a team around each initiative
  who can manage the content which they will later add to the initiative page. Link
  initiative pages wherever you''d like! Story Maps Share maps, videos, dashboards
  and, of course, stories with a Story Map made to your specifications. Explore a
  story map showing Hub Sites around the world on the right. Learn more about how
  to build your own story map. Hubs Around the World Open Data Share your parcel data
  with other agencies, municipalities and the public. Explore all of the parcel data
  being shared publicly using ArcGIS right now. Web Maps and Applications Sometimes
  the most effective way to share your data is with an interactive map. Keep it simple!
