description: 'FEMA  Mitigation - Montana  DR-4655  Resource  Center The FEMA Mitigation
  Montana DR-4655 Resource Center is an information platform that organizes programs,
  people, and tools to support communities through programmatic initiatives during
  disaster operations. Best Available Floodplain Mapping Information (BAI) All activity,
  including flood recovery projects, located in

  flood hazard areas requires local coordination and must meet all federal,

  state, and local regulations.  This may include but is not limited to a

  floodplain development permit, site drawings, plans, survey/elevation

  information and engineering analysis.  It is important to contact the

  local jurisdiction early during the project design phase to avoid unnecessary

  costs or delays.  When in doubt, contact the community here. Carbon County, Montana

  Management &amp; Insurance Reported Impacted Hotspot Analyses This hotspot analysis
  takes into account the reported Individual Assistance (IA) inspections and National
  Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) claims combined.  Due to the delicate nature and
  protective restrictions of this information, it was aggregated using a kernal density
  process.  Using this method versus a grid methodology allows the data to determine
  the inherent pattern of damage, and not be confined to a set of finite parameters.This
  data is exaggerated to account for potential damages and impacts outside of the
  reported cases, and provides an area of interest to support other program areas
  or data collection efforts.  Data is as of July 29th, 2022. Hotspot Analysis can
  be accessed here and below:  https://fema.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=869f2c7ceba94055889a18304d26d6ea
  High Water Mark (HWM) Acquisition High water mark data collection provides a unique
  opportunity to capture observed flood evidence that occurred during a specific flooding
  event in our history.  HWM''s are a perishable dataset and only available immediately
  following a disaster and requires an urgent and accurate approach to achieve a high
  level of fidelity in the data. High water marks indicate the height or elevation
  of peak flooding illustrated by water lines left behind during a specific flooding
  event.  HWMs can be applied to wide variety of hydrology, land use, and emergency
  management applications across several local, state, and federal program areas.
  The US Geological Flood Event Viewer (FEV) is a platform for publishing HWMs and
  other flood event data.  When HWMs are published on the FEV, they are freely accessible
  to the public for use in analytics, documentation, and all the benefits noted above.

  Department UAV Footage Local fire departments serving Fromberg and Red Lodge collected
  unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video footage of the impacts during the DR-4655 event.
  Below is a web application built for the UAV video captured of the DR-4655 impacts. 
  The site can also be accessed here:  Montana Floods Video Viewer (arcgis.com) Civil
  Air Patrol (CAP) Civil Air Patrol is a congressionally chartered, federally supported
  non-profit corporation that serves as the official civilian auxiliary of the United
  States Air Force. CAP is a volunteer organization with an aviation-minded membership
  that includes people from all backgrounds, lifestyles, and occupations.  When a
  disaster strikes, CAP is deployed to capture either orthorectifed imagery or more
  recently drone video footage of impacted areas. The CAP web mapping application
  can be access here and below https://fema.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=df98bad528d447e7836e4a477451d25e.
