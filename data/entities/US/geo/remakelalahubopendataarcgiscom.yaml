  \ South LA Old Model vs New Model According to what we see as the old economic model,\
  \ private investors partner with public initiatives to build brick and mortar facilities.\
  \ The relationship results in a Return on Investment (ROI) for the corporations\
  \ and focused development/redevelopment of specific sites. However, where is the\
  \ community in the decision-making process? What is their direct and/or spill-over\
  \ benefit? It is time for a New Model for South LA, in which the community actively\
  \ drives and benefits from investments and transformations. Community Events Get\
  \ Involved! The Mayor's Operations Innovation Team is working to coordinate citizens,\
  \ businesses, and government. By hosting public engagement meetups and in-person\
