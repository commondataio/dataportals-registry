description: Shimberg Center Spatial Data Providing Housing Data to the Public The
  Shimberg Center for Housing Studies was established at the University of Florida
  in 1988 to promote safe, decent and affordable housing and related community development
  throughout the state of Florida. Affordable Housing Our current research focuses
  on documenting housing market conditions and affordable housing needs in Florida's
  counties, cities and neighborhoods; preserving Florida's affordable rental housing;
  linking affordable housing with land use and transportation decisions through GIS
  modeling; and supporting the development of energy efficient and healthy homes.
  Florida Housing Data Clearinghouse Florida Housing Data Clearinghouse The Shimberg
  Center produces the Florida Housing Data Clearinghouse, which provides public access
  to data on housing needs and supply for Florida's cities and counties. Disaster
