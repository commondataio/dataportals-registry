  throughout the state of Florida. Affordable Housing Our current research focuses
  on documenting housing market conditions and affordable housing needs in Florida's
  counties, cities and neighborhoods; preserving Florida's affordable rental housing;
  linking affordable housing with land use and transportation decisions through GIS
  modeling; and supporting the development of energy efficient and healthy homes.
