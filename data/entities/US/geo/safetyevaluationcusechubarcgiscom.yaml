description: "CUSEC Safety Evaluation Hub CUSEC, in partnership with FEMA's National\
  \ Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and the U.S. Department of Homeland\
  \ Security, Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T), has developed a mobile\
  \ data collection tool for post-disaster safety evaluations. Developed with several\
  \ Esri technologies, the CUSEC \"Safety Evaluation App\" operates on mobile devices\
  \ and was designed to speed data collection by professionals who assess buildings\
  \ and structures for safe occupancy following a disaster. The app includes data\
  \ entry forms that are used by field evaluation teams and maps that provide evaluation\
  \ results and situational awareness to emergency managers. The Safety Evaluation\
  \ App was first developed and tested in 2015. It has since been refined with feedback\
  \ from state programs including the Missouri SAVE Coalition, Arkansas INSPARK program,\
  \ Tennessee SAVE Coalition, and Indiana I-BEAM program. These groups use the app\
  \ as part of their training curriculum and plan to use it for real-world deployments\
  \ as well. Use the links below to test out features and functionality, access training\
  \ materials, and transition it to your ArcGIS Online organization. INSPARK Safety\
  \ Assessors Inspect Arkansas (INSPARK) The INSPARK Hub contains instructions and\
  \ other resources for both training/exercise and real-world operations. Tennessee\
  \ Structural Assessment and Visual Evaluation Coalition (TNSAVE) The TNSAVE Hub contains\
  \ instructions and other resources for both training/exercise and real-world operations.\
  \ Missouri Structural Assessment and Visual Evaluation Coalition (MOSAVE) The MOSAVE\
  \ Hub contains instructions and other resources for both training/exercise and real-world\
  \ operations. Test Drive the Safety Evaluation App Data Input Option 1: App for\
  \ iOS, Android, PC or Mac Access and Analyze Results in a Dashboard The Safety Evaluation\
  \ App is comprised of several Esri technologies which have been customized to support\
  \ post-disaster safety evaluation data collection and situational awareness. Below\
  \ are links to demonstration versions of the primary components of the app. To test\
  \ drive the components, first input and submit a sample data point into the Survey123\
  \ App or web form, and then use the Operations Dashboard to view your results. If\
  \ you've never used one of the components listed below, there are several reference\
  \ materials and video tutorials provided further down the page. Please note that\
  \ this Survey123 form is for demonstration purposes only and should never be used\
  \ in a real-world event. After you've used the Safety Evaluation Survey to input\
  \ data, You can view results with the Safety Evaluation Dashboard. Safety Evaluation\
  \ App Training Material Below are videos and reference materials that provide basic\
  \ instructions on how to perform data collection using the Safety Evaluation App.\
  \ Note that there are several versions of Esri's Survey123 App, which is the basis\
  \ of the mobile data collection process for the Safety Evaluation App. Depending\
  \ on your operating system, select one of the videos below to watch a brief tutorial\
  \ on how to input data into the app on your mobile device, or using the web form.\

  \ Transition the App to your Organization Transition this Template CUSEC has created\
  \ an easy way for ArcGIS Online organization \nadministrators and publishers to\
  \ transition the Safety Evaluation App to their own ArcGIS Online Organization.\
  \ The transition tool \nuses ArcGIS Online Notebook to migrate the components of\
  \ this template \nto a folder within your own organization. While further sharing,\
  \ \nimplementation, and customization of the application is up to individual\n organizations,\
  \ the transition tool enables administrators a quick, \noff-the-shelf solution for\
  \ deployment. To transition this template to your own organization, click here or\
  \ fill in the form at the bottom of this page. Resources Regional SAVE Coalitions\
