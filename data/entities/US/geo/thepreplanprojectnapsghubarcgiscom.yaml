description: A Lost Firefighter is either Dumb or Dead Using Map Based Pre-Incident
  Planning provides a lot of benefits and albeit a couple of challenges.  Below is
  a list of the pros and cons for using GIS or other mapping platforms for fire department
  pre-incident planning Pros Cons Hello, my name is Chris Rogers.  For over 30 years
  I have been using GIS in many ways to increase the ability to manage information
  for fire departments.  I have experimented with several ways to manage information
  leveraging both ESRI and other technologies to create maps and applications for
  pre-incident information.  This includes As I approach the end of my career in the
  fire service (who knows when for sure), it is my obligation to the fire service
  to share what I know so that it can be passed on to fellow firefighters.  So, I
  want to introduce "The Preplan Project" (it is the best catchy name that I could
  produce). The Preplan Project is a demonstration project using the latest technology
  to render and present "preplan" information in a variety of ways.  Preplan information
  can include building preplans, geographic area preplans, or even wildland preplans. 
  This project will be an ongoing effort and includes maps and apps that leverage
  some of the following In addition, I will be attempting to crosswalk several initiatives
  that have some complementary uses in pre-incident planning.  This includes More
  to follow.  This will be an ongoing project with intermittent updates. The use of
  GIS in creating pre-incident plans was born out of necessity to reduce duplicate
  work.  In the late 1990's the Kirkland Fire Department was already using ArcView
  3.2 and eventually ArcGIS 9.1 to create the map books and wall maps for the fire
  stations.  The pre-incident planning program languished for years without any real
  progress from hand drawn site plan diagrams.  Many attempts were made to use software
  like Visio and AutoCAD but the learning curve for on duty firefighters was steep
  and the production time consuming. For all intents and purpose a pre-fire or pre-incident
  diagram is a map.  Much of the required data that is required for a pre-incident
  diagram include Kirkland and the surrounding area have excellent GIS data (street
  edge of pavement, centerline data, and building data) and the fire department maintains
  accurate hydrant, and address information.  This caused us to explore using GIS
  for most of our source data for the diagrams. The first attempts involved using
  these layers in conjunction with AutoCAD where we had most of the building symbols. 
   This was convenient considering that if anything like hydrant location changed
  would be reflected on the pre-fire.  It was still time consuming considering that
  you had to maintain the drawing in AutoCAD and then add the data as a theme in ArcView.
