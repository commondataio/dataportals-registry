  \ access web map services, and interactive mapping applications. Westchester County\
  \ GIS Established in the late 1980's, Westchester County Geographic Information\
  \ Systems (GIS) develops, maintains and distributes geospatial data for Westchester\
  \ County, New York. The program offers a wide range of online data as well as providing\
  \ technical support to both local and county government agencies through highly\
  \ trained and experienced staff. Today, many Westchester County GIS products and\
  \ services are also integrated into and provide content for commercial and third-party\
  \ applications. Westchester County GIS pioneered development of the first countywide\
  \ digital base map in 2000 which now provides the spatial foundation of the County's\
  \ GIS program. Subsequent photogrammetric projects in 2004, 2007, 2013 and 2018\
  \ provided the basis for ongoing maintenance of strategic countywide orthophotograpy\
  \ and large-scale planimetric datasets. Historic aerial photography, dating back\
  \ to 1947, has also been made available in many online mapping applications. About\
