description: 'What is the state of gender equality in the world? What do data tell
  us about progress towards the commitments made in the Beijing Platform for Action,
  which, 25 years after its adoption, remains the most comprehensive road map for
  advancing women''s rights worldwide. Importantly, in adopting the 2030 Agenda for
  Sustainable Development in 2015, Member States reaffirmed, in Sustainable Development
  Goal 5, that gender equality is central to the achievement of sustainable development
  for all by 2030. As has been done at five-year intervals since the adoption of the
  Beijing Platform for Action, The World’s Women 2020 takes stock of progress in advancing
  women’s rights, empowering women and girls and ensuring gender equality in the world
  community. The World’s Women 2020 is a collection of 100 stories providing up-to-date
  assessments of progress towards gender equality in the following six critical areas,
  including, under each area, the impact of COVID-19 on women: (a) population and
  families; (b) health; (c) education; (d) economic empowerment and asset ownership;
  (e) power and decision-making; and (f) violence against women and the girl child.
