  to the City of Peachtree Corners Open

  Data site. The City of Peachtree Corners Geospatial data repository is designed

  to support the city’s Communications, Community Development, Land Development,

  Public Works, Zoning and Environmental Assessments. The data repository

  development involves a process of spatial data creation, data acquisition and

  dissemination which is geared to meet the data quality needs of the city.  The data
  availability service covers a period

  of years ranging from 2012 to 2022. The City of Peachtree Corners has also developed

  a comprehensive quality assurance plan for its enterprise wide data and has

  maintained the same level of service over the years. Find Data Explore Focused Datasets

  the process of data development and acquisition of spatial data, a few key

  areas are considered a top priority; these include the level of accuracy,

  completeness and consistency.  We have

  designed a data evaluation process for data quality and consistency and these

  tests are designed to hunt for specific types of errors and frequency of data

  modification.  To maintain the spatial

  data quality over time, evolving data (i.e. temporal specific) maintenance and

  quality-testing procedures have been developed to ensure the integrity of the

  data and to properly implement its dissemination. Arbitrary

  quality checks on the developed or acquired data are performed and diagnostics

  routines and reports are also developed and monitored over an extended period

  in time.  A key component of our successful

  data maintenance effort is the involvement of a focus group which consists of

  geospatial analyst’s, planning and historic data professionals with considerable

  spatial analytic interests assisting with the quality effort. Street Network Configuration
