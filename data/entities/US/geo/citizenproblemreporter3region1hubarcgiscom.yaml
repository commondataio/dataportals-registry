  at the same time. List of Upcoming Events Frequently Asked Questions Common questions
  you may be asking about the Citizen Request Center. Can I track the status of my
  service request? Do I have to create an account when I submit a service request?
  How do I provide feedback after the request has been completed? Does the Call Center
  handle emergency services? Yes, you can search for your request and check the status
  of your request at any time. If you create an account and login when you submit
  the request you can view 'My Submissions' in the Citizen Problem Reporter app. No,
  you can remain anonymous when you submit a request. However, responsible agencies
  may want to follow up so providing contact information often ensures requests can
  be resolved more quickly. If you share your email address with us, we’ll send you
  a satisfaction survey after the work has been completed. No, the Call Center only
  handles non-emergency service requests.  Call 911 in the case of an emergency (burning
  house, accident, robbery, crime in progress, etc.) Service Request Data Authoritative
  data used to collect non-emergency service requests and track the status of each
  request. Streets Animal Other
