description: UNFPA Population Data Platform Stories Explore ICPD data and create stories
  The UNFPA’s Population Data Platform brings together indicator, population and spatial
  data to help increase capacity to access and use these data as a public good. Here
  you can explore and interact with these data to build a StoryMap to highlight ICPD
  goals and issues. Workshop Portal The PDP storymaps workshop will guide you through
  the process of creating a StoryMap in ArcGIS online, using data hosted in the population
  data platform. The workshop portal introduces concepts of Data Exploration, Analysis
  and Visualization,  Building and Publishing the story. Data Warehouse Data are the
  backbone of storymaps. The PDP’s data warehouse manages existing datasets available
  for the creation of new maps. Search here for data on ICPD indicators, boundary
  data and more. Storymap Gallery Storymaps are used around the world to communicate
  data and ideas. Here are some examples to get you inspired. Storymap This sample
  storymap highlights how maps, data and content can be seamlessly brought together
  to highlight important issues. Click here to open the sample Storymap in another
  new tab. Explore Data Use this search to find data, maps and applications within
  the PDP. Search results can be filtered according to their tags, type or other attributes.
  Click here to access Data Warehouse page. Share Ideas &amp; Get Inspired! As we
  build and grow the PDP, we look forward to posting new developments and applications
  on social media.  When your storymap is published, you can post it and spread the
  word! FEEDBACK SURVEY unpfa.org   |   UNPFA Publications   |   UNPFA News   |   UNPFA
