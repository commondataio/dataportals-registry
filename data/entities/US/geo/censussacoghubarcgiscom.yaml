  and Demographic Data for the SACOG Region The data on this site is for use with
  the Census MAF/TIGER database, the Census data site, or with other statistical applications.
  2020 Census Data is available for the six counties in the SACOG region. The counties
  included are El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento, Sutter, Yolo, and Yuba. The demographic
  data contains Decennial Census P.L. 94-171 Redistricting Data. Block groups are
  an aggregation of blocks; they are the next level up in the census geography hierarchy.
  Blocks are the smallest geographic unit available and are the basis for all other
  census geographic tabulations. Decennial Census 2020 includes tabulations of housing
  units, total population and population by race and by Hispanic or Latino origin,
  and total group quarters population. Data are summary statistics for population
  and housing from a "100% count." The Census Bureau attempts to survey or interview
  all known addresses. Geographies nationwide can be obtained from Census, with disaggregate
  geographic detail down to Block-level. SACOG is publishing files for 2020 Blocks,
  Block Groups, Tracts. The Decennial Census PL94-171 reports summary statistics on
  population and housing for use in redistricting. The Census Bureau attempts to survey
  or interview all known addresses. Still, the data are subject to error. The errors
  derive from survey data collection (response errors, field follow-up for missing
  cases) and processing by the Census Bureau (geolocation of population and housing,
  data coding, compilation processes, and imputation of missing cases). Further information
  about accuracy is available atÂ Census Bureau Releases Estimates of Undercount and
  Overcount in the 2020 Census. Other Sites Contact Information Info@sacog.org Copyright
