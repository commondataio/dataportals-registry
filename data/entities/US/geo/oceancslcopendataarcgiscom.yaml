description: Open Data Ocean planning is a comprehensive, stakeholder-driven process
  that considers the dynamic and interconnected relationship between the ocean environment
  and the human uses within this environment to manage resources and activities effectively
  and responsibly. In order to better inform decision making, data available on the
  Ocean Planning Mapping Application is available here for search and download. Please
