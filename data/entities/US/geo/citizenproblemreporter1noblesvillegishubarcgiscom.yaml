  you will find some of the Citizen Problem Center's most commonly asked questions.If
  you have further questions, please contact the Call Center by phone at 317-776-6325
  or via email. Can I track the status of my service request? Do I have to create
  an account when I submit a service request? How do I provide feedback after the
  request has been completed? Does the Call Center handle emergency services? Yes,
  you can search for your request and check the status of your request at any time.
  If you create an account and login when you submit the request you can view 'My
  Submissions' in the Citizen Problem Reporter app. No, you can remain anonymous when
  you submit a request. However, responsible agencies may want to follow up so providing
  contact information often ensures requests can be resolved more quickly. If you
  share your email address with us, we’ll send you a satisfaction survey after the
  work has been completed. No, the Call Center only handles non-emergency service
  requests.  Call 911 in the case of an emergency (burning house, accident, robbery,
  crime in progress, etc.)
