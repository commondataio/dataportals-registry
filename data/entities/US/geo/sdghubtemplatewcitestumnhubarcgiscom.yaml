description: 'West Central Initiative SDG Hub Tracking our region''s progress towards
  the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Developed by world experts, the United Nations
  have agreed on 231 unique indicators of progress. Those data sets for our mostly
  rural geography are incomplete. We’re partnering with other state SDGs leaders and,
  together, we’re populating the dashboard with available data sets as we discover
  and verify them. SDG 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
  2019 was the second warmest year on record and the end of the warmest decade (2010-
  2019) ever recorded. Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and other greenhouse gases in the
  atmosphere rose to new records in 2019. Climate change is affecting every country
  on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting lives. Weather
  patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, and weather events are becoming more
  extreme. Although greenhouse gas emissions are projected to drop about 6 per cent
  in 2020 due to travel bans and economic slowdowns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,
  this improvement is only temporary. Climate change is not on pause. Once the global
  economy begins to recover from the pandemic, emissions are expected to return to
  higher levels. Saving lives and livelihoods requires urgent action to address both
  the pandemic and the climate emergency. The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, aims
  to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global
  temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial
  levels. The agreement also aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with
  the impacts of climate change, through appropriate financial flows, a new technology
  framework and an enhanced capacity building framework.. We fuel insight and action
  for the benefit of our region and our world for generations to come. When you donate
  to West Central Initiative, you make all of this—and more—possible: Community Action
  fjkidla;fjieoajfieoap Community Action We aim to cultivate a greater sense of possibility
  and confidence in what we can do together, building capacity inside our organization
  and across our region to seize opportunities, try new things, and learn from all
  we do.'
