description: "Resilient MA was created by the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy\
  \ and Environmental Affairs to support the Commonwealth with climate change science\
  \ and tools. This maps and data center features interactive applications to explore\
  \ the latest statewide climate data and projections curated to support climate resilience\
  \ in Massachusetts. Resilient MA Map Viewer Resilient MA Climate Change Projections\
  \ Dashboard Explore the latest statewide climate projections for MA.  Led by the\
  \ Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA), in partnership with\
  \ Cornell University, U.S. Geological Survey and Tufts University, the Massachusetts\
  \ Climate and Hydrologic Risk Project (Phase 1) has developed new climate change\
  \ projections for the Commonwealth. Select a watershed basin, target future decade\
  \ and desired season to see temperature and precipitation projections. Click on\
  \ the stacked squares icon in the locator map and select \"IDF Sites\" and select\
