description: "University of Edinburgh &amp; MapAction: Volcanic Hazard Mapping Project\
  \ Presenting volcanic hazard maps to be useful, usable, and used Generating hazard\
  \ maps for potentially active volcanoes is recognized as a fundamental step towards\
  \ mitigation of risk to vulnerable communities. Hazard maps are communication tools,\
  \ and although they are simplified, their content embodies a wealth of information\
  \ about a given volcano. However, hazard maps are most commonly presented as large\
  \ format paper maps, and/or available digitally to download. These methods to communicate,\
  \ and distribute this knowledge are now a limiting factor in their usefulness. In\
  \ June 2018 we collaborated with the charity MapAction to generate the first ever\
  \ 3D interactive web map for hazards at a volcano. We trailed this approach with\
  \ Fuego volcano in Guatemala after an eruption. The web map was visited over 26,000\
  \ times in two months. It was used by emergency managers, local government, NGOS\
  \ and the public. Volcanic hazard information in this format is democratised, and\
  \ the usage of the map was simply unprecedented. In this project we want to combine\
  \ our NERC project – which hinges on improving simulation tools used in making hazard\
  \ maps, and our collaborations with MapAction, to develop on our experience with\
  \ the Fuego map to generate a suite of new 3D interactive web maps for 18 volcanoes\
  \ around the world. Locations Volcanic Hazard Mapping Locations volcanic-hazard-mapping-locations\
