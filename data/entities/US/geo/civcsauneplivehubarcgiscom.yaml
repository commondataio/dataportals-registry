description: 'Together with FAO and IOM, UNEP is a partner in the “Peacebuilding in

  the north-eastern border region of Côte d’Ivoire through participative and

  planned management of natural resources” project – a 2.5-year initiative (2021-2023)
  funded

  by the UN Peacebuilding Fund (PBF). While a number of studies on climate related
  security risks have been conducted in the broader Sahel region,

  localized assessments remain rare. Furthermore, standardized processes are still

  lacking for integrated risk assessments at this level. As a key contribution to
  this project, UNEP has conducted a local-level assessment of the impacts of climate
  and environmental change on socio-economic dynamics and resulting risks for the
  project area. This website presents the results of the assessment in a dynamic and
  interactive way. Note: This website is a prototype and is currently under development.
