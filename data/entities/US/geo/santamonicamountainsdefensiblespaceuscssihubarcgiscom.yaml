description: Santa Monica Mountains This Hub was created to provide accessible data
  surrounding defensible space information to better prepare homeowners in the Santa
  Monica Mountains in their fire resiliency practices Why Does Defensible Space Matter?
  Defensible space can be the defining factor between the survival or destruction
  of a house when wildfire strikes. A buffer created through landscaping can prevent
  the spread of flames from enveloping houses. Prevention techniques such as buffer
  zones and home hardening can help keep your home safe. Read below for more information
  on defensible zones, the stakeholders participating in this issue, and how these
  areas play into the larger landscape of the area in regards to wildlife and habitat
  areas. This Hub focuses on the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area Boundary
  and uses this as the study area for the data and analysis included on this website.

  different topics involved in the fire resiliency Buffer Impact Vegetation Sensitivity
  Impact Analysis The consequential impact defensible space buffer zones have on the
  environment in terms of vegetation and habitat is an important consideration in
  the design and size of these spaces. This analysis looks at how different size buffer
  zones depending on fire risk could impact the environment differently. Defensible
  Zones Case Study Analysis and Fire Resiliency Techniques A case study location in
  the Santa Monica Mountains study area is explored to provide an example of whatÂ defensible
  spaces can look like in an interactive three-dimensional format. Additional resources
  are provided, delving into good landscaping and home hardening practices. Stakeholders
  Analysis Learn More Stakeholder Input and Interactive Map The involvement and understanding
  of the stakeholders involved in this issue can help to inform future policy issues.
  Additionally, numerous jurisdictions and areas of responsibility split the study
  area in the Santa Monica Mountains. An interactive map including these different
  stakeholders is found on this page so that users can understand who is in control
  in their area. Search Data by Categories Navigate below to find data on specific
