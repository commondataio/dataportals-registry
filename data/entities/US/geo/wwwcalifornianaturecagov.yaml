description: 'Conserving 30 percent of California’s lands and coastal waters by 2030
  What is 30x30? In October 2020, Governor Newsom issued Executive Order N-82-20 which
  establishes a

  state goal of conserving 30% of California’s lands and coastal waters by 2030 –
  known as 30x30. The 30x30 goal is intended to help accelerate conservation

  of our lands and coastal waters through voluntary, collaborative action with partners
  across the state to meet three objectives: conserve and restore biodiversity, expand
  access to nature, and mitigate and build resilience to climate change. California’s
  30x30 commitment is part of a global effort to increase biodiversity conservation,
  including in the United States. In January of 2021, the Biden

  administration issued an Executive Order on tackling the

  climate crisis and committed the United States to 30x30

  through its America the Beautiful initiative. Check out the Resources Page for more
  information on the Pathways to 30x30 strategy, explore the CA Nature mapping applications
  to see progress and find conservation opportunities, and catch up on the great work
  the 30x30 Partnership is advancing throughout the state on the Engagement Page.
