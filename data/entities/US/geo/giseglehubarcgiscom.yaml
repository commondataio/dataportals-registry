  It is important to be aware of what harmful algal blooms are, when and where they
  occur, and why you should care about them. This story map covers all that and more
  including how to prevent and report blooms if you suspect there may be one on a
  waterbody in Michigan. For questions about this topic, please contact AlgaeBloom@Michigan.gov.

  Formerly MiWaters, the focus of MiEnviro Portal is permitting and compliance for
  air quality and water resources, including National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
  System (NPDES), storm water, groundwater discharge, aquatic nuisance control, Part
  41 construction, medical waste registrations, and land and water interface permits.
  The viewer is intended to be used as one tool to assist in identifying wetlands
  and provides only potential and approximate location of wetlands and wetland conditions.
  This application provides a wide array of geologic information for natural resource
  management, educational and general interests.  Additional programs are not needed
  but can be added to suit individual needs. The Michigan Environmental Mapper provides
  an online interactive map for the following sites: Sites of contamination regulated
  under Part 201; Leaking underground storage tank sites (both active and closed)
  regulated under Part 213; Underground storage tank facilities (both open and closed)
  regulated under Part 211; and Land Use Restrictions. Open Data search, download,

  Boundaries Sustainability or explore our most popular datasets: What is Geographic
  Information Systems (GIS)? This is a way to map, analyze, and collect data that
  has a spatial component (like an address or coordinates). GIS is used in every one
  of our divisions at EGLE. Read the article "Fast Five with EGLE staffers on GIS
  Day" to learn more about how EGLE uses GIS to make a difference! Also be sure to
  check out the "What makes EGLE Spatial" story map for even more examples. Screenshot
