description: 'A platform of geolocalized urban data informing ongoing post-blast recovery
  efforts Explore our Initiatives and Projects Damage Assessment (OEA) Our Dataset
  Al-Masar al-Akhdar The Observatory includes various datasets, research projects
  and initiatives. This map displays the damage assessment survey conducted by the
  Order of Engineers and Architects (OEA) in Beirut in the aftermath of the Beirut
  port blast. The buildings are categorized according to the four levels of damage
  assessed by the Order. This base map displays various sets of data at the Municipal
  Beirut scale. These include geolocalized urban, social and economic information
  on building activity. The data relates to several aspects of the city, such as housing,
  infrastructure and zoning. This project showcases the trajectory of the previously
  planned Fouad Boutros highway, and advocates for a project that reclaims its public
  open spaces into a green path connecting Hikmeh to Karantina, which we are calling
  Al-Massar Al-Akhdar. Open Spaces and Community Support Projects Socio-Economic Profile:
  Karantina Return of Life: Gemmayze, Mar Mikhael and Hikmeh This dataset displays
  publicly and privately owned vacant lots as well as gives information about their
  conditions in the neighborhoods affected by the Beirut port blast. The map also
  locates a first set of community support projects led by CSOs, NGOs and INGOs. In-depth
  surveys were conducted by the Karantina recovery research team and trained local
  researchers. The surveys included socio-economic profiling of households, businesses,
  a damage assessment, aid and relief efforts and mapping of the socio-spatial practices.
  This map assesses preliminary return to life to the blast affected neighborhoods
  looking at the external condition of buildings and their occupancy rates on one
  side, and by identifying the opening or closure of businesses in selected commercial
  streets on the other. Mapping NGOsâ€™ Repairs Between March and September 2021, BUL
  researchers identified about 80 NGOs that participated in the shelter repairs within
  the neighborhoods severely affected by the August 2020 port blast. Between March
