description: "The Global Midwives' Hub A Resource to Improve Health Outcomesand Advocate\
  \ for Midwifery Welcome to the Global Midwives' Hub The Global Midwives' Hub is\
  \ a\ndigital data resource where midwives and midwives’ associations can discover\
  \ information about the state of their profession and the need for safe delivery\
  \ services. This information will help them to advocate\nfor a midwife-led continuity\
  \ of care and to strengthen maternal and newborn health\nservices within their countries\
  \ and regions. Developed by the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) and\
  \ Direct Relief, the Global Midwives' Hub is designed with input from midwives,\
  \ and\ndisplays data generated by the midwifery profession as well as official global\
  \ sources such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Population\
  \ Fund (UNFPA). ICM and Direct Relief share a mission to improve maternal and newborn\
  \ health globally. These two organisations are working together to leverage data\
  \ to empower midwives in their efforts to inform policy makers of their vital role\
  \ in saving lives and strengthening communities. The State of the World's Midwifery\
  \ (SoWMy) 2021 is here! The\nevidence is in: investing in midwives saves lives,\
  \ improves maternal and newborn health and\nstrengthens health systems. The SoWMy\
  \ 2021 was launched on 5 May 2021 by The United\nNations Population Fund (UNFPA),\
  \ the World Health Organization (WHO) and the\nInternational Confederation of Midwives\
  \ (ICM). A detailed analysis of data collected from WHO National Health Workforce\
  \ Accounts (NHWA) and through the ICM Midwives' Association Survey provides evidence\
  \ on the quality and coverage of midwifery services. On the Global Midwives' Hub,\
  \ data can be displayed graphically, through country and regional maps and other\
  \ visualisations. Combine the 2021 report findings with a map of your location,\
  \ highlighting both the density of midwifery workforce, and the number of women\
  \ of childbearing age to advocate for an increased health workforce. Explore the\
  \ data for information you can use to improve the health of women and newborns.\
  \ Focus your search thematically or by geographical location. Data provided in the\
  \ SoWMy report can strengthen efforts for evidence-based policy making that supports\
  \ global midwifery. Click here to access the full SoWMy Report Hub_Stats Sheet1\
