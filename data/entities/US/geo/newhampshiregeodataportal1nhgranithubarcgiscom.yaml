  User Survey and Results NH GRANIT: New Hampshire''s Statewide GIS Clearinghouse
  The New Hampshire Geographically Referenced Analysis and Information Transfer System
  (NH GRANIT) is a cooperative project to create, maintain, and make available a statewide
  geographic data base serving the information needs of state, regional, and local
  decision-makers. A collaborative effort between the University of New Hampshire
  and the Office of Planning and Development at the NH Department of Business and
  Economic Affairs, the core GRANIT System is housed at the UNH Institute for the
  Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space in Durham. It includes a geographic database;
  hardware and software to build, manage, and access the database; and a staff of
  experts knowledgeable in geographic information systems, image processing, and computer
  analysis. In addition to database development and maintenance, the GRANIT staff
  offers a range of application development, training, and related technical services
  to GIS users in the state and the region. The GRANIT approach to a statewide GIS
  depends upon the cooperative efforts of a host of agencies, collaborating on various
  elements of database design and construction as well as application development.
  The collaboration occurs formally through the NH GIS Steering Committee, the NH
  GIS Advisory Committee, and the NH Technical Users Group, as well as informally
  through daily interactions within the community of GIS users in the state and the
  region. About Contact Us UNH Logo'
