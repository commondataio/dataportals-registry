description: The Place for Indiana Geospatial Information Welcome to the new site!
  IndianaMap is a strategic resource providing a collection of authoritative data
  and web services.  It is an organized effort of partners throughout Indiana, involving
  local, state, and federal agencies, private sector and academia.  Search for or
  browse the data, use within your own application, analyze with your choice of tools,
  or build your own apps. IndianaMap is maintained for the Indiana GIS Community by
  the Indiana Geographic Information Officer (GIO) in partnership with geoConvergence
  and the Indiana Geographic Information Council (IGIC). The menus below provide direct
  download options for some of IndianaMap's large datasets, particularly for data
  harvest program layers. As we work to improve performance of file generation for
  these layers we encourage users to download them from this menu. Users can also
  select the option to navigate to an external site to download data at a county level.
  Please note that all links to the county-level datasets are for file geodatabases
  with all data harvest layers for that county. To visit the 2022 data harvest dashboard,
