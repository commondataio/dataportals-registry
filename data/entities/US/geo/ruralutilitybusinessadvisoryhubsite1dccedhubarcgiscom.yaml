description: "Meet your Local Government Specialists The goal of the RUBA program\
  \ is to increase the managerial and financial capacity of rural water and wastewater\
  \ \nutility providers. RUBA staff work with Alaskan communities to improve their\
  \ overall managerial and financial operations through the use of Best Practices\
  \ criteria. The program is advisory only; travel and assistance is at the request\
  \ of local utility staff The federal government amended the Safe Water Drinking\
  \ Act in 1996 to require states to ensure that new systems \nare viable and that\
  \ there is sufficient local technical, managerial, and financial capacity to operate\
  \ the water \nor wastewater system. The RUBA program began in 1994 and continues\
  \ to provide the technical, managerial, and financial \ntraining and assistance\
  \ as mandated. This page will tell you more about the RUBA program and how to connect\
  \ with its resources. Utility Management Training (UMT) Courses The Rural Utility\
  \ Business Advisor (RUBA) program offers Utility Management Training courses on\
  \ utility-related topics in various locales statewide on a cost\n    reimbursable\
  \ basis. Many of these courses have also been adapted for online delivery, allowing\
  \ utility staff to receive training without leaving their communities. Upcoming\
  \ trainings may be found here. RUBA Publications The RUBA program offers several\
  \ publications designed specifically for rural Alaskan utilities that address different\
  \ parts of utility management. Rural Utility Business Advisor (RUBA) Program Grant\
