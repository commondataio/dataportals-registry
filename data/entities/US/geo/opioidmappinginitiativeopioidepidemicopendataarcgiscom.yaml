description: "Opioid Mapping Initiative Local governments working together to address\
  \ the epidemic with data and maps Mapping the Opioid Epidemic New 2019 Report Here:\n\
  https://www.newamerica.org/public-interest-technology/reports/mapping-opioid-epidemic/\
  \ For all the national media attention it has attracted, the opioid crisis remains\
  \ a local problem, demanding that local governments try innovative strategies to\
  \ fit their communities’ unique needs. Many do this through the Opioid Mapping Initiative\
  \ (OMI), a coalition of 17 local governments, universities, and nonprofits who meet\
  \ monthly to swap insights, share best practices, and test their theories of change.\
  \ This report documents the efforts of the Opioid Mapping Initiative through its\
  \ first year.  In the report you will find case studies are included from a variety\
  \ of the participating local governments, as well as maps showing a national perspective\
  \ on various aspects of the opioid epidemic. The Opioid Mapping Initiative is a\
  \ community of practice that includes leading local government health and law enforcement\
  \ agencies, technologists, and researchers committed to engaging their communities\
  \ in partnerships to improve awareness of the opioid epidemic and make better decisions\
  \ with government resources. The purpose of the initiative and this site is to provide\
  \ a list of applications and open data sets that local health and law enforcement\
  \ agencies have identified as important to their communities.  It also provides\
  \ critical and timely resources, including: technical guidance and best practices,\
  \ success stories; how-to articles; and links to related efforts. Agencies that\
  \ lead the way in mapping the epidemic can be instrumental in helping others learn\
  \ as additional governments embrace technology fighting the epidemic. For a more\
  \ detailed overview  on datasets and participating please see this document: Opioid\
  \ Mapping Initiative Overview Below you will find: 1. News and articles about local\
  \ governments mapping the epidemic 2.  Examples of applications the government has\
  \ provided the public 3. Open datasets which those applications use In October of\
  \ 2017 the initiative launched with several governments sharing practices via monthly\
  \ webcasts.  In February of 2019 the webcasts have concluded.  However, the examples\
  \ below are still very relevant and news articles will continue to be shared. A\
  \ New America Public Interest Technology Initiative National Naloxone Access and\
  \ Prescriptions Drop Box Maps Work has begun on creating national maps for\n1) Where\
  \ to access naloxone- pharmacies and clinics providing Naloxone to the public. \
