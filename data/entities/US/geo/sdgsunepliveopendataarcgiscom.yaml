  Sustainable Development Goals sdgs UN Environment Live Map As custodian agency for
  26 indicators of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), UN Environment is actively
  involved in the development and refinement of data collection methodologies, particularly
  for those indicators that remain without internationally established methodologies
  and standards (Tiers II and III). In this effort, UN Environment periodically organizes
  Expert Group Meetings, Capacity Building and Pilot Testing to seek outside expertise
  from colleagues in academia, civil society, the private sector, and other intergovernmental
  agencies. View the Map SDGs Policy Briefs The Sustainable Development Goals Policy
