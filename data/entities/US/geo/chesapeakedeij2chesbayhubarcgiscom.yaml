description: 'Environmental Justice and Equity Dashboard The Chesapeake Executive
  Council’s Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Justice (DEIJ) Statement commits to including
  DEIJ in all areas of Chesapeake Bay restoration and conservation. To help workgroup
  leaders identify opportunities to implement DEIJ into their work, we have developed
  the Chesapeake Environmental Justice and Equity Dashboard, a web application that
  integrates data from multiple sources to convey demographic, socioeconomic, environmental,
  and programmatic topics connected to the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement and
  Chesapeake specific DEIJ initiatives. The dashboard is currently accessible in this
  draft or beta release as we collect information from users on content and usability.
  Please send comments or suggestions to diversitydashboard@chesapeakebay.net. Dashboard
  Overview What is the Dashboard? The Environmental Justice and Equity Dashboard provides

  access to a variety of spatial data layers pertinent to addressing environmental
  issues in areas with underrepresented populations, which include communities of
  color, low income, and linguistically isolated communities.

  These data reflect demographics of underrepresented populations,

  environmental justice and public health issues, quality of life concerns, and

  other data important for additional Outcomes of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement
  of 2014. Integrated Outcomes include: The purpose of the Chesapeake Bay Environmental
  Justice and

  Equity Dashboard is to consolidate and provide access to this information in

  one cohesive location and to provide guidance on how and why the information

  should be used. WetlandsForest BuffersTree CanopyStream HealthWatershed Implementation

  Resiliency The Dashboard contains information that can be useful to many different
  users involved in conservation and restoration planning including local planners,
  state agencies, watershed groups, etc. Some of these uses include: Addressing diversity
  interests in Goal Implementation Team Management Strategies and Action Plans.Identifying
  restoration and conservation opportunities while incorporating environmental justice
  and equity issuesAssessing demographic and socioeconomic conditions in areas identified
  as priorities for other OutcomesOutreach and communication of environmental justice
  and equity information to stakeholders concerned with other environmental topicsBuilding
  local environmental justice stories to engage with stakeholders How can I get started?
  The information in the Dashboard is organized into modules, represented by the tabs
  across the top of the Dashboard, that each contain information to answer questions
  related to that particular module. Each module contains multiple sections with their
  own guidance on the information provided and how to use it. You can: Click on a
  module tab at the top of the page to read more detail about each module and explore
  the tools in its sections.Utilize the table below to determine which module contains
  the information you''re trying to find. Photo: Will Parson Example Uses What are

  Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Opportunity Zones Navigation Each Module
  contains a preconfigured assortment of map layers based on topic, as well as the
  ability to add additional map layers by leveraging the Add Data widget.  Please
  see the "Overall Map Architecture" graphic below for an at-a-glance view of the
  default contents of each Module. Quick Start Information (About Widget) describes
  how to interact with widget windows and describes the map layers (and groups of
  layers) accessible in that map window. The Layer List widget provides a list of
  operational layers and their symbols and allows you to turn individual layers on
  and off. Each layer in the list has a check box that allows you to control its visibility.
  Some layers contain sublayers or subtypes. The Legend widget displays labels and
  symbols for layers in the map.  The order in which layers appear in the Legend widget
  corresponds to the layer order in the map. The Basemap Gallery widget presents a
  gallery of basemaps and allows you to select one from the gallery as the basemap
  for your app. The Bookmark widget stores a collection of map view extents (that
  is, spatial bookmarks) displayed in the app. It also allows you to create and add
  your spatial bookmarks after the app starts. In addition, if there are any existing
  bookmarks defined in the map, you can use them in the app optionally. The Print
  widget connects the web app with a printing service to allow the current map to
  print.  The user can specify selections for format and layout as well as advanced
  options for map scale, extent, and print quality. Updates Update Tracker 12/27/2022
