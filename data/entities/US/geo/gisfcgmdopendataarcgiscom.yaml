  Information Systems (GIS) operates under the Inter-agency Information Technologies
  (IIT) Division to provide data support for various citizen services and county government
  agencies. GIS is a framework for gathering, managing, and analyzing data. Rooted
  in the science of geography, GIS integrates many types of data. It analyzes spatial
  location and organizes layers of information into visualizations using maps and
  3D scenes. â€‹With this unique capability, GIS reveals deeper insights into data,
  such as patterns, relationships, and situations, helping users make smarter decisions.
