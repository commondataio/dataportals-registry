description: "Vital Signs Open Data Portal Vital Signs are data-points compiled from\
  \ a variety of reliable sources \nthat “take the pulse” of Baltimore’s neighborhoods.\
  \ These \ncommunity-based indicators form a picture of any given neighborhood’s\
  \ \nquality of life and overall health. Vital Signs help community members, \ndecision\
  \ makers, and funders to measure progress towards meaningful, \npositive outcomes\
  \ at the community level, and measure needs in specific \nand actionable ways. Explore\
  \ the indicators below, either using a keyword search or exploring the Vital Signs\
  \ topic areas. Explore the Indicators: Census Demographics Housing and Community\
  \ Development Children and Family Health Crime and Safety Workforce and Economic\
  \ Development Arts and Culture Education and Youth Sustainability Chapter Narratives\
  \ About Vital Signs are clusters of neighborhoods and are organized around Census\
  \ tract \nboundaries, which are consistent statistical boundaries. In some cases,\
  \ \nCSA boundaries may cross neighborhood boundaries. There are 55 CSAs in \nBaltimore\
  \ City. Neighborhood lines often do not fall along CSA \nboundaries, but CSAs are\
  \ representations of the conditions occurring \nwithin those particular neighborhoods.\
  \ The CSAs were originally created \nin 2002 and were revised for Vital Signs 10\
  \ using new 2010 Census Tract boundaries. There are no anticipated boundary revisions\
  \ in 2020 but some CSA names were updated to reflect the history and identity of\
  \ the City's neighborhoods. Learn more and download reference GIS layers and crosswalk\
  \ files The data is an open-source and available for others to use for their \n\
  integral needs. Whether it is personal projects, mapping tools, \nsoftware, student\
  \ projects, individual and organizational research, \narticles and blog posts, BNIA\
  \ has you covered. Community members and \nleaders may find it most useful to examine\
  \ their community’s data in \ncontext to the city or adjacent communities to assess\
  \ the areas of most \nneed and progress.If you have any questions about these datasets\
