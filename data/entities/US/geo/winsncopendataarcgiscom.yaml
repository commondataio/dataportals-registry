  Water Habitat The Sierra Nevada Watershed Information Network (WIN) provides an
  online environment that connects resources, partners, successes, failures, lessons
  learned, needs, opportunities, and existing Watershed Improvement Program (WIP).
  The Sierra Nevada WIN also provides opportunities to explore new ways of integrating
  the three pillars of the WIP (investment, policy, and infrastructure) in order to
  restore Sierra Nevada forests to a state of health and resilience. Use these interactive
  map apps to answer questions and make new discoveries about the Sierra Nevada Region.  Learn
  more about current and past wildfires, and the values that they impact in the State
  of California. Understand the important role the Sierra plays in combating climate
  change and the threats we face. Learn more about the risks facing California’s primary
  water source – the Sierra Nevada Region. Learn more about California animal species
  and the threats to their crucial Sierra Nevada habitat. Explore a Watershed Contact
