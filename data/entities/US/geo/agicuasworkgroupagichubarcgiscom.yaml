  The FAA has partnered with Aloft (formerly Kittyhawk) to redevelop the FAA''s first
  mobile application, to improve the user experience so that recreational flyers know
  whether it is safe to fly their drone. The app provides situational awareness to
  recreational flyers and other drone users. It does not allow users to obtain airspace
  authorizations to fly in controlled airspace, which are only available through the
  FAA''s Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC).  Select the
