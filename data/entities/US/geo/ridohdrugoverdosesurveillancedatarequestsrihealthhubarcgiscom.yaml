  to make overdose information available to allow for community response, using data
  to drive action. Surveillance systems include: Emergency response opioid overdoses:
  Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Runs | Data DictionaryEmergency Department (ED)
  Visits | Data Dictionary Non-fatal overdose toxicology: Biosurveillance | Data Dictionary
  Fatal overdoses: Office of the State Medical Examiners (OSME) | Data Dictionary State
  Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS) | Data Dictionary Controlled

  Looking for raw data? RIDOH’s policy for reviewing and accommodating individual-level
  data requests is as follows: Step One: Submit a Raw Data Request Form Download and
  complete RIDOH’s Raw Data Request Form.Submit the completed data request form to
  RIDOH.DOSPDataRequest@health.ri.gov.Once submitted, a RIDOH Substance Use Epidemiology
  Program representative will contact you with any questions. Additional information
  may be requested to confirm the relevancy of the proposed research study question.
  Note: Each research project requires the completion and submission of a separate
  Raw Data Request form. Step Two: Submit an application for Institutional Review
  Board (IRB) Review Upon RIDOH approval of the Raw Data Request Form, please complete
  and submit an IRB application to RIDOH.IRB@health.ri.govBe sure to include the approved
  RIDOH Raw Data Request Form as part of your IRB application; this is a required
  component of the IRB application. Please visit the RIDOH IRB webpage for more information
  and to download an application form. After IRB review, you will receive a letter
  from an IRB representative indicating approval, exemption, or denial. If your IRB
  application is approved or exempted, you will work with RIDOH staff to develop a
  Data Use Agreement (DUA) for your project. Step Three: Transfer of Data The data
  can be transferred once all steps have been completed and a DUA has been signed
  by both your institution and RIDOH. Aggregate data tables, such as counts aggregated
  by geography or time, are available to view and download from the Data Hub. Click
  on the icons below to see data that are currently available. If you are unable to
  find the data you are looking for on this website, complete the Drug Overdose Surveillance
  Aggregate Data Request Form. This Data Hub adheres to RIDOH''s Small Numbers Reporting
  Policy to ensure the confidentiality of individual identities. Data are suppressed
  when counts are less than five. Any future use of counts to construct proportions,
  rates, and other statistics is subject to reliability and confidentiality verifications.
