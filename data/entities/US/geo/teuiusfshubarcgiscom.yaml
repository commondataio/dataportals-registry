description: 'Terrestrial Ecological Unit Inventory (TEUI) is the USDA Forest Service''s
  system of classifying natural communities and mapping their individual components
  at different spatial scales. The system categorizes different land characteristics
  such as geology, climate, soils, hydrology and vegetation, creating maps based on
  geospatial data. These maps and descriptions are applied in land use planning and
  management to identify the ability of specific land areas to support various uses.

  TEUI Projects TEUI projects are often interchangeable and may explore many different
  ways that natural communities interact. These projects may include soil surveys
  and mapping, formal studies to determine the health of natural communities, data
  mapping, and the distribution and movement of water. Here you will find: A map of
  TEUI projects across the nation Additional resources and web maps TEUI for Practitioners

  Regional TEUI Sites - Coming Soon Each Forest Service Region is at a different phase
  with TEUI. The regional sites help explain how TEUI is being established, collected,
  and used within each region and may also highlight specific regional TEUI products.
  Note - Not all regions have a regional site yet. These sites are being developed
  as TEUI becomes established within regions.'
