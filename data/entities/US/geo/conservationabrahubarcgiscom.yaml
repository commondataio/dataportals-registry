  \ Farm Apex Clean Energy Lobbyists and legislators have persistently promoted off-highway\
  \ vehicle recreation on West Virginia's public lands, Federal and state, for the\
  \ last two years.  For obvious reasons, the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy\
  \ strongly opposes allowing this activity on our public lands. Since at least 2016,\
  \ Aston Bay Holdings has drilled more than 20 exploratory holes in the A-1 agricultural\
  \ zone on land situated between Yogaville and the Union Hill community. Other Buckingham\
  \ County locations are also being targeted. According to its website, the company\
  \ has exploration agreements on almost 5,000 acres surrounding the Buckingham gold\
  \ vein. In total, it has options to lease mineral rights on more than 11,000 acres\
  \ in central Virginia. Corridor H of the Appalachian Development Highway System,\
  \ also known as US 48, will extend 157 miles from northern Virginia to central West\
  \ Virginia. It is being constructed from Interstate 79 (I-79) in Weston eastward\
  \ across the Allegheny Mountains to I-81 in Strasburg, Virginia. The Parsons to\
  \ Davis Project is an approximately 10‐mile, new location, four‐lane, divided highway,\
  \ with partial control of access. Apex Clean Energy is working to complete development\
  \ and start construction on Rocky Forge Wind, potentially the first onshore wind\
  \ farm in the Commonwealth. The project will produce up to 75MW of electricity from\
  \ 14 turbines, each up to 620 feet tall. The project will provide enough energy\
  \ to power up to 21,000 homes. Explore Conservation Hub initiatives within and around\

  \ 2023 Land Application of Biosolids: Are toxic chemicals being spread on our agricultural\
  \ land? Wastewater treatment plants don't just treat sewage. They also process materials\
  \ from food production and other industrial facilities. Some also treat landfill\
  \ leachate, which is known to contain toxic chemicals, such as PFAS, also known\
  \ as \"Forever Chemicals\". Working with local scientists and Virginia DEQ, this\
  \ Hub project aims to understand: What, exactly, are \"biosolids\"? Where are they\
  \ coming from and where are they going? Do current regulations protect our land?\

  \ Greenbrier Southeast Grassy Ridge The National Forest Integrity Project is a sister\
  \ program of the ABRA Conservation Hub. It monitors U.S. Forest Service actions\
  \ with the aim of improving transparency and promoting public participation. According\
  \ to the US Forest Service, the proposed Upper Elk River project aims to contribute\
  \ to the resiliency of the landscape by improving the health and diversity of forests\
  \ in the face of a changing climate. According to the US Forest Service, the proposed\
  \ Upper Cheat project aims to move the Upper Cheat watershed closer the 2006 Revised\
  \ Forest Plan by improving forest health and age class diversity, wildlife habitat,\
  \ as well as riparian conditions and habitat. According to the US Forest Service,\
  \ the proposed Cranberry Spring Creek (CSC) project will emphasize improvement of\
  \ forest health and visitor experience and move toward management objectives outlined\
  \ in the Forest Plan for the Monongahela National Forest (MNF). The project includes\
  \ commercial timber harvest, road construction, and work related to habitat and\
  \ recreation enhancement, as well as a focus on cultural resources. According to\
  \ the US Forest Service, the proposed Gauley Healthy Forest Restoration Project\
  \ will involve ecosystem management activities intended to protect against insect\
  \ or disease infestation, or that reduce hazardous fuels. The project activity area\
  \ includes about 3,000 acres of timber harvest and 60 miles of temporary road construction.\
  \ The total project area, north and east of Richwood, WV, covers about 40,000 acres.\
  \ According to the US Forest Service, the Greenbrier Southeast project seeks to\
  \ improve forest stand health and composition to improve future wildlife habitat\
  \ and to provide for future commercial timber sales and economic projects. The project\
  \ area is located in northern Pocahontas County, WV, approximately 2 miles east\
  \ of Bartow, WV. Explore Conservation Hub Data Selected data sources hosted by the\
