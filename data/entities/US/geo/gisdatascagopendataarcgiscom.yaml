  \ all important aspects of building a sustainable region. As such, the region is\
  \ in a unique position to build a clean energy economy, with livable communities\
  \ and efficient buildings near clean transit. Go Human is a campaign that encourages\
  \ Southern Californians to use human-powered transportation and change how we think\
  \ about others on the road. Walk. Bike. Go Human. REVISION is a regional mapping\
  \ and analysis application that integrates a range of public and private data for\
