  Data Using Dashboards Dashboards take maps to the next level.  They allow the City
  to present data analysis with easy-to-use interactive data visualizations.    Auburn's
  dashboards are generally tailored to specific projects, giving users the ability
  to explore and slice the data to get the answers they need. Visit our Applications
  Gallery for more dashboards! Explore Current Initiatives What is an Initiative? 
  Initiatives are the big projects the City of Auburn is working on.  Initiatives
  often involve more than one city department as well as citizen groups.  Initiative
  sites provide a comprehensive collection of information, maps and resources related
  to a topic. Visit our Applications Gallery for more map, dashboards, and initiatives!
