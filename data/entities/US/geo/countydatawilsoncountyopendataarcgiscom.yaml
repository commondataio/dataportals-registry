description: Wilson County Open Data Discover, Download, Explore Welcome to the Wilson
  County Open Data Portal Wilson County is proud to provide county stakeholders with
  high-quality public information and source data in order to facilitate improved
  community engagement and informed decision-making. Our open data site offers the
  ability to Search, Filter, Download and use API Access to our data. Users can find
  a variety of data and information on this portal for use in Spreadsheets, Shapefiles,
  and Web Applications. Wilson County uses a Geographic Informational System, or GIS,
  to depict property boundaries as a visual representation of the cadastral information
  taken from primary sources such as deeds, plats, and surveys strictly for the purpose
  of creating a representation of real estate for use by Wilson County and its various
  departments for taxation, zoning, or other governmental purposes. Interested parties
  should use the information developed from GIS property mapping as a basis for further
  investigation into the primary sources of deeds, plats, and surveys. Parties should
  not use the information provided by GIS property boundaries as a substitute for
  primary sources of cadastral information. GIS Property maps are not intended to
  be surveys. Search for Data Explore your data Agriculture Physical Features Boundaries
