  HERE! _________________________ GIS at Alabama 811 Alabama 811 processes close to
  3,000 requests for underground utility location daily. These requests are publicly
  available and easily searchable through our internal web portal at Alabama 811 Web
  Portal for advanced attribute based searching.  However, in many cases a spatial
  search of the data can help answer a more specific question.  We believe that this
  data could be extremely valuable for individuals and organizations throughout the
  state and have published historical and real time data for analysis.  We hope that
  this data will help utilities, first responders, planners, and other stakeholders
  make decisions that will help protect our underground infrastructure and make it
  safer for everyone who works around and depends on underground facilities in the
  State of Alabama. July 2019 Location Requests Heatmap What are some potential use
  cases for this data? We want to encourage usage of the 811 system throughout the
  state, and by publishing our data we believe that we can encourage greater participation
  in Alabama 811. We also envision other potential uses for our data includingGrowth

  of Auburn, AL with July 2019 Location Requests Growth Analysis Areas of high growth
  are easily identifiable within locate request data by the types of work performed
  along with new construction along with a high volume of new requests within a defined
  area. Permitting Oversight Using the Alabama 811 data, municipalities can ensure
  that work done throughout their respective areas is properly permitted. Emergency
  Response In the event of an excavation related emergency responders could quickly
  determine what type of work was being performed and identify a field contact for
  the excavation. How are we publishing our data? Locate requests created within the
  last twenty working days are available real time through the Active Tickets Buffer
  View feature service.  Data older than twenty working days is removed nightly. 
  This data includes a small subset of the locate request's attributes including the
  type of work being performed, the type of request, and the excavator name. Active
