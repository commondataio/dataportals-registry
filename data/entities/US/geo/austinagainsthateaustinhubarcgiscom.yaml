  \ to file a crime or incident report( non-emergency) directly with APD online Providing\
  \ education on hate crimes/incidents on the Understanding Hate Crimes Web page Get\
  \ Informed What are Hate Crimes and Hate Incidents? You may hear the words Hate\
  \ Crimes and Hate Incidents used interchangeably. However, there is a difference\
  \ between the two, especially when it comes to the law. A Hate Crime is a criminal*\
  \ act committed against a person or person’s property that is motivated by bias\
  \ against a person’s or group’s race, color, disability, religion, national origin\
  \ or ancestry, age, gender, sexual preference, gender identity and expression, or\
  \ status as a peace officer or judge. A Hate Incident is an act motivated by bias\
  \ that may not rise to the level of a criminal act. * It is important to note that\
  \ Texas does not have a separate hate crime offense. Instead, the Texas Hate Crimes\
  \ Act allows for the enhancement of the punishment for certain crimes.\nFor a deeper\
  \ dive on the definition of hate crimes and incidents, what is law in Texas, and\
  \ what happens when you file a report visit the Austin Police Department’s Understanding\
  \ Hate Crimes web page Diverse group of people standing at brick wall Join us for\

  \ or Hate Incident The City of Austin takes reports of hate crimes and incidents\
  \ seriously. If you see or experience an act of hate it’s important to report it\
  \ as quickly as possible. If there is a crime in progress or an immediate threat,\
  \ call 911. If the crime or incident has already occurred and there is no immediate\
  \ danger, the fastest way to report it is to use the Austin Police Department (APD)\
  \ using iReport online report tool Your information goes directly to APD and is\
  \ immediately assigned a case an official police report number. You can use that\
  \ number to check the status of your report. If you want to give a report over the\
  \ phone, call 3-1-1. The call-taker will send the information you share to APD.\
  \ An officer will contact you to gather additional information to file a police\
  \ report. Be sure to provide a call-back number where you can be easily reached.\
  \ If you are unsure if you should file a report, have questions, comments, concerns,\
  \ or are looking for an update on a case, you can email APDHateCrimes@austintexas.gov.\
  \ While not all hate incidents rise to the level of a crime, they are all unacceptable\
  \ and should be reported. Incidents such as verbal taunts, bullying, hate propaganda\
  \ and non-physical harassment can be reported at ADL.org. ADL responds to these\
  \ incidents by providing support, guidance and resources to individuals, schools,\
  \ employers and organizations to ensure a safer, more inclusive community for all.\
  \ Tracking Hate and Bias in Austin: What our data is telling us Two key data sources\
  \ offer insight on the type and number of hate crimes being reported in Austin and\
  \ the community’s overall sense of safety and trust. Those sources are APD police\
  \ reports and a community survey that provides results based on responses from a\
  \ statistically valid cross-section of respondents that reflect Austin’s demographics.\
