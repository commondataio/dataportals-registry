  Documents + Resources\nContact Common Ground for People and Water Hoboken’s largest\
  \ park will provide recreation and public space for our community. It will also\
  \ be a fundamental part of Hoboken’s resiliency strategy by integrating green infrastructure\
  \ and innovative stormwater management measures to mitigate flooding from rainfall\
  \ events. The park will foster a healthier environment for all to enjoy. Building\
  \ the Northwest Resiliency Park Effective September 9, 2019 the temporary Northwest\
  \ Pop-up Park was closed for construction of the permanent Northwest Resiliency\
  \ Park. Please visit the Construction Updates tab for information on construction\
  \ activities including important notices for neighbors. Learn more about construction\
  \ of the Northwest Resiliency Park. Northwest Resiliency Park Design The Northwest\
  \ Resiliency Park will transform an asphalt covered site into a vegetated park filled\
  \ with amenities for the Hoboken community, while filtering and storing stormwater\
  \ to alleviate the City’s infrastructure system and adjacent nuisance flooding.\
  \ A balance of Nature, Culture, Athletics, and Play were identified as the top aspirations\
  \ for a resiliency park in a growing neighborhood, along with the basic amenities\
  \ of trees and human comfort needs. A full overview of the design can be found in\
  \ the Design tab above as well as the Concept Design Report available in the Documents\
  \ + Resources tab. See the latest presentation here: March 6th 2019 City Council\
  \ Presentation Hoboken's Next Resiliency Park In 2016, the City of Hoboken acquired\
  \ 6 acres in Northwest Hoboken to transform a former industrial site into the city’s\
  \ largest public park. Initially envisioned in the 2004 Master Plan, the Northwest\
  \ Resiliency Park is a key feature of the City’s comprehensive water management\
  \ strategy for making Hoboken more resilient to flooding, storms, and sea level\
  \ rise. The Northwest Resiliency Park will build upon the City’s ongoing efforts\
  \ to integrate resiliency into park projects, such as the Southwest Park and 7th\
  \ &amp; Jackson Park. The City of Hoboken opened the 1 acre Southwest Park in September\
  \ 2017. Southwest Park is the first resiliency park in Hoboken and the state of\
  \ New Jersey, and is designed with integrated green infrastructure to hold approximately\
  \ 200,000 gallons of stormwater runoff to reduce localized flooding. The park at\
  \ 7th &amp; Jackson Streets is under construction and will hold greater than 450,000\
  \ gallons of stormwater runoff. \nLearn more about the Southwest Park. New Map Resilience:\
  \ Water + People To foster both social and physical resilience, the design of the\
  \ park will include public space aligned with the aspirations of the community that\
  \ is closely integrated with stormwater infrastructure systems to achieve flood\
  \ mitigation and water quality goals.\n\n\nThe Northwest Resiliency Park will manage\
  \ at least one million gallons of stormwater. It will play an important role in\
  \ the mitigation of flooding from frequent storm events and help to relieve the\
  \ overtaxed combined sewer system.\n\n\nThrough innovative stormwater measures within\
  \ an urban public space, this water infrastructure will form a foundation for a\
  \ park that promotes both physical and social resilience in a growing community.\
  \ While the park works to manage stormwater, it will also provide a place for neighbors\
  \ to meet, play, exercise, learn, and relax. The Park Site Originally marshland,\
  \ this area of Hoboken was infilled and the site was occupied by a chemical plant\
  \ from 1922 until 2004. Now vacant, the City’s \n2004 Master Plan \ncalled for acquiring\
  \ the 6-acre site for new parkland. Following Hurricane Sandy in 2011, the City’s\n\
  2014 Green Infrastructure Strategic Plan   \nand \n2015 Re.Invest Feasibility Study\
  \ \nidentified the site’s potential as a green infrastructure and flood management\
  \ park, now part of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Rebuild\
  \ by Design competition (RBD) competition launched in 2013.\n\n\nThe site was purchased\
  \ by the City in December of 2016 from BASF. Prior to site acquisition, BASF completed\
  \ site-wide soil remediation and capped the entire lot with 6-inches of asphalt.\
  \ The former BASF property was remediated to levels that safely allow for many activities,\
  \ including public access and use for passive and active recreation.  The interim\
  \ use as a pop-up park, and future use as a permanent resiliency park with stormwater\
  \ management is in full compliance with NJDEP and USEPA requirements for the property,\
  \ and poses no human health risk to the recreational users of the park.\nAn integral\
  \ part of project design will be safely and responsibly managing the legacy of contamination\
  \ in this former industrial neighborhood. The project team will work closely with\
  \ environmental officials and engineers to ensure a safe, efficient, and cost-effective\
  \ transformation of the site into a resiliency park. Learn more about the park site.\

  \ (FEIS) Pop-up Park A temporary pop-up park activated the future site of the Northwest\
  \ Resiliency Park from June 2017 through September 2019 while the design for the\
  \ permanent park was completed. The temporary park will remain in operation until\
  \ construction begins on the permanent resiliency park.\n\n\nA community outreach\
  \ process solicited ideas and feedback on design options for the pop-up park. The\
  \ outcome of the pop-up park outreach serves as the foundation of an ongoing community\
  \ and stakeholder engagement process that will inform the future resiliency park.\n\
  \n\nBuilding upon the initial outreach conducted for the pop-up park, a series of\
  \ community events throughout the design process will help to inform the programming\
  \ and design of the future resiliency park. Engage Now Infrastructure is not resilient\
  \ unless it benefits the people living with it every day. A resilient park must\
  \ be well-adapted to both the needs of both the surrounding community and the entire\
  \ City of Hoboken. The design of the park engaged community members to contribute\
  \ ideas, hopes, and concerns for their future park.\n\n\nThe engagement process\
  \ included a community interest survey, public participation events in Hoboken,\
  \ a community design charrette, and several public meetings to foster collaboration\
  \ between the design team, the City, and the people of Hoboken. The team will also\
  \ solicited ideas for the “North Lot” which may include programming in addition\
  \ to the park. Learn more about engagement opportunities. Home\nEngage Now\nPark\
