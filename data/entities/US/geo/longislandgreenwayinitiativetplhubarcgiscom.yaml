description: 'An extension of the Empire State Trail The Project In 2017, Governor
  Cuomo announced the Empire State Trail, a continuous 750-mile route slated to become
  the longest multi-use trail in the country. It will span the state from Plattsburgh
  and Buffalo to New York City. But it ends in Manhattanâ€”leaving out the 7.8 million
  New Yorkers who live east of the city. The Trust for Public Land has a plan to change
  that by creating a historic trail that will connect the residents of Long Island
  (including Brooklyn and Queens) to the Empire State Trail. Our Progress Feasibility
  Study Phase 1 Community Outreach Design + Construction 2018-2019 We started by identifying
  a feasible 175-mile east-west route across Long Island using GIS analysis and gathering
  input from the local community. 2019-2020 We conducted a detailed ground survey,
  analyzed infrastructure, identified access points, held stakeholder meetings, and
  addressed maintenance issues. 2020-current We''re seeking feedback from residents,
  business leaders, government officials and even you. Please fill out this survey
  with your input. 2021-2022 The State of New York will construct the first 25 miles
  of the Long Island Greenway. Long Island Greenway LongIslandGreenway Off-Road Miles

  and road crossings are under discussion with town and county officials and are
