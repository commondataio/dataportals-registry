description: 'Welcome to the CDOT Portal A new search experience for CDOT maps, apps,
  and data is here! A new platform for exploring CDOT maps, apps, and data. CDOT collects,
  stores, and generates vast amounts of data through multiple sources and divisions.  Creating
  a portal that makes it easier to access maps, apps, and data from across the agency
  is invaluable to maximizing understanding of CDOT operations. The CDOT Portal offers
  data accessibility and exploration while showcasing maps, apps, data, dashboards,
  viewers, and more. It has been designed to maximize the discovery, use, analyses,
  and understanding of CDOT data.  The ability to discover relevant data is a prerequisite
  to big data and catalyzing the use of data to enhance strategic planning and data
  driven decisions. The CDOT Portal is a Beta site, and content will continually be
  added.  As the portal grows, more data from across CDOT Divisions will be accessible
  in a single place. You will be able to explore a catalogue which includes a wide
  variety of information related to maintenance, traffic &amp; safety, infrastructure/assets,
  and more. Don’t worry!  As this site is built out, you will still be able to access
  CPLAN and OTIS for additional CDOT information and data. We just made it easier!  Links
  to those sites are included on this landing page – only one click away! Applications
  are an important dimension of this portal.  They have been developed leveraging  CDOT
  data, CDOT map layers and, where applicable, external data.  You will find mobile
  applications to streamline workflows. You will find interactive viewers and dashboards
  which offer visualizations of CDOT data. Visualizations allow for the direct interaction
  with data in ways that are dynamic and engaging.  They can help identify trends,
  previously unknown correlations and patterns, distill increasing amounts of information,
  and transform raw data into actionable insight. The portal is unlocking data silos,
  exposing the data and, significantly, providing context to the data which is as
  important as the data itself.  Datasets on the portal will include enhanced metadata
  – that is, enhanced descriptive information about the data which maximizes understanding
  and use. Context helps explain the data. Context is critical to inform decisions
  and analyses based upon the data. Context aids in the interpretation of the data.
  Context enables consumers of data to extract maximum value from the data. There
  are many ways to use the CDOT portal. Discover content that’s relevant to you. Search
  by keyword, or browse by category. A User Guide, in the form of a StoryMap, has
  been developed for new users to the platform.  It will guide the user on how to
  use the platform including: all the functionality and features of the platform,
  how to access data on the platform, how to explore the data, and more. The StoryMap
  can be found in the lower left hand side of the landing page. We are also anxious
  for your feedback, and have included a link to a feedback survey at the bottom of
  the landing page. Have fun on your data discovery journey! Open Data CDOT View All
