description: "Sierra Nevada Strategic Investment Plan (SNSIP) Understanding the Sierra\
  \ Region's Opportunities for State Investment Sierra Nevada Strategic Investment\
  \ Geographies The Sierra Nevada  region  is of critical importance to the state,\
  \ but is at high risk—and our window for protecting it is narrowing quickly. We\
  \ have the opportunity to create a much-needed model of how agencies can work beyond\
  \ silos and effectively protect regions critical to the well-being of California\
  \ as a whole. SNSIP provides agencies a means to identify common issues and best\
  \ opportunities for granting agencies to work effectively and strategically in the\
  \ Sierra Nevada region. Thoughtful, strategic coordination between our SNSIP partners’\
  \ resources will result in a balance of short and long-term restoration and resilience\
  \ results. How these geographies were developed. The SNSIP geographies were developed\
  \ with the following process: The Seven SNSIP Geographies SNSIP_DBv2 SNSIP_SNC_ProposedWebMerc_ValuesV1\
  \ Comparison of SNSIP Geographies by Size Below you will find a series of proof\
  \ of concept prototype dashboards and maps to better understand the intersection\
  \ of challenges and opportunities across the region and in the SNSIP geographies.\
  \ These prototypes focus on using 2-4 key data sources to show where the largest\
  \ need and potential opportunity for State investment are in each geography. Analysis\
  \ for Developing Data-driven Actions Forest Health\nChallenges The three SNSIP geographies\
  \ with the greatest number of acres facing\nchallenges are: These are based on the\
  \ following metrics: Forest Health\nChallenges Water Supply Challenges The three\

  \ (FRID) An Example of Opportunity and Risk Across the Sierra The dashboard below\
  \ gives an overview of a few key data sets and high-level analysis used to understand\
  \ the way that opportunity and risks spread across the SNSIP geographies. Draft\
  \ Dashboard this will change!!!! Data-driven Actions: Regional characteristics and\
  \ associated actions SNSIP regional characteristics were used to develop a menu\
  \ of associated actions that can be combined to address the unique needs of each\
  \ SNSIP region. These actions could be implemented through SNSIP Partner funding\
  \ programs either in a coordinated multi-agency effort, or by individual agencies.\
  \ Large WUI: Small WUI: High levels of built infrastructure: Low levels of built\
  \ infrastructure: High current wildlife connectivity: Low current wildlife connectivity:\
  \ A high number of priceless landforms e.g. meadows, vernal pools: A small number\
  \ or rare landforms e.g. meadows, vernal pools: High Biomass/Carbon retention potential:\
  \ High Biomass/Carbon volatility potential: High value to out of region water/power:\
  \ Low value to out of region water/power: Low or disconnected economic and organizational\
  \ capacity: Recreation large economic effect: Recreation low economic effect: Significant\
  \ fuel reduction efforts connecting across the landscape with infrastructure fuel\
  \ breaks to keep closed canopy forest to reasonable patch sizes. Community targeted\
  \ fire protection fuel reduction, connecting to key infrastructure e.g. water, power,\
  \ escape routes, etc. Forest thinning should be connected across the landscape by\
  \ infrastructure oriented protecting fuel breaks. Fuel breaks should be targeted\
  \ at protecting specific infrastructure. Landscape-scale (HUC 10) or larger restoration\
  \ programs that keep the habitat viable and restore large-scale ecosystem function.\
  \ Additional restoration should bridge wildlife through populated regions or protect/restore\
  \ disappearing resources. Focus restoration to provide additional benefits to other\
  \ categories e.g. water supply or connectivity and to form networks of restoration\
  \ with a goal of landscape (HUC 10) level restoration Retain the last vestiges of\
  \ the habitat and restore to provide biodiversity on a local level. Forest restoration\
  \ should focus on retention and encouragement of larger older growth trees. Where\
  \ larger older stands exist, they should be a high priority for protection through\
  \ the restoration of the stand and the surrounding area. Forest restoration should\
  \ focus on mitigating large volumes of dead pool biomass from volatilizing and entering\
  \ the atmosphere. Projects should focus on HUC12 or smaller that protect individual\
  \ supplies. Projects that bring unique value to the local community and boost their\
  \ self-reliance. Projects that provide sustained local citizen buy-in and build\
  \ economic independence. Leverage projects to enhance recreation opportunities,\
  \ increase carrying capacity while dispersing visitors. Combine recreation projects\
  \ with community development to bring economic vitality to disconnected communities.\
  \ Restoration at the HUC10 upper watershed scale should benefit water supply and/or\
  \ hydropower systems making them less susceptible to high severity fire and sediment\
  \ loading. Applying Data-driven Actions to SNSIP Geographies Sacramento - Feather\

  \ Though the east side is a critical water source it consists of relatively small\n\
  streams. Recreation is a major economic driver. Relatively small amounts of the\n\
  forest are commercially used or private. Meadows, riparian areas and forest\nfloor\
  \ snow retention are critical for wildlife and water reliability. Consider the\n\
  multiple values of combining restoration that focuses on riparian areas and\nsnow\
  \ retention through non-commercial thinning to reduce type conversion.Combine fire\
  \ preparation projects with recreation through trail building and\nmaintenance.\
