description: One-stop shop for all parcel information Maps used in the process of
  real estate transfer and taxation are referred to as tax maps. These maps are generated
  by way of recorded instruments (deeds, plats, etc.) based on surveys composed by
  surveyors licensed with the State of Ohio. Stark County’s tax maps are maintained
  using a geographic information system (GIS). Real Estate Search The Real Estate
  Search is a resource to search for a property by owner name, address, or parcel
  number. For those used to the old way of searching for parcel information, this
  resource will link you to the old maps rather than the basic or advanced parcel
  viewers. Contact Information taxmap@starkcountyohio.gov  330-451-7341 gis@starkcountyohio.gov
