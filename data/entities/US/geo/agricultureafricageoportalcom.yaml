description: "Agriculture in Africa Integrate Earth observations, imagery, field data,\
  \ agribusiness and\n  real-time data streams to develop sustainable agricultural\
  \ practices and\n  improve understanding of the food balance sheet. Make better\
  \ decisions faster.\n  Monitor and forecast production to sustainably feed Africa's\
  \ growing\n  population. Explore, access and contribute to resources and initiatives\
  \ to improve agricultural practices and production in Africa through data and GIS\
  \ technology Agriculture in 2050 Understanding the changes in the agricultural landscape\
  \ due to climate change is essential and spatial data can play a key role in modelling\
  \ and mapping the variables and analysing the impact. This dashboard is an example\
  \ of a suitability study done for Ethiopia using data from Africa Geoportal to get\
  \ an understanding of the impact of climate change on wheat farming in 2050. The\
  \ study was documented in this storymap. Explore more through the agricultural segments\

  \ Plan for the future...now Understanding how our world has changed can provide\
  \ insight into building a more sustainable and prosperous future. By analyzing historic\
  \ global land cover data and observing change over time, we can make fundamental\
  \ predictions and forecast growth patterns for the future. Sustainable Agriculture\
  \ Development Regenerative agricultural practices can protect the environment, improve\
  \ soil fertility, and optimize long-term profitably to create greater food security.\
  \ Collect &amp; map baseline data and monitor change to understand how no-till,\
  \ cover crops, rotational grazing, and other sustainable practices contribute to\
  \ better soil health, biodiversity, and CO2 sequestration, and support SDG’s. Additional\
  \ Resources Using UAVs to Aid Policy &amp; Decision-Making To highlight the utility\
  \ of UAV imagery for evaluating the health and preparedness of coastal ecosystems\
  \ and infrastructure, a series of pilot studies were conducted for priority areas\
  \ identified by the USAID-Ghana Sustainable Fisheries Management Project (SFMP).\
