  \ Project Kāhua O Kāneiolouma is a sacred cultural site containing remnants of an\
  \ ancient Hawaiian village located in the heart of Po‘ipū, Kōloa, Kaua‘i. The 13-acre\
  \ village contains remnants of hale, fishponds, taro fields, auwai irrigation systems,\
  \ shrines, and a makahiki arena dating back to the mid 1400’s. After decades of\
  \ neglect and hurricane damage, Hui Mālama O Kāneiolouma, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit\
  \ organization, formed in 2009 with the purpose to fully restore the village. In\
  \ 2010 the County of Kaua‘i granted formal stewardship of Kāneiolouma to the Hui,\
  \ and this agreement was recently extended through the year 2037. Ke'e Beach Hāʻena\
