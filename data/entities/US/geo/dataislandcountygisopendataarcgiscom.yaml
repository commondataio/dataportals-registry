  These maps were created from available public records and existing map sources,
  and from different surveyors and their surveys. Map features from all sources have
  been adjusted to achieve a ‘best fit’ registration to the Ownership parcels. While
  great care was taken in this process, maps from different sources rarely agree as
  to the precise location of geographic features. The relative positioning of map
  features to one another results from combining different map sources without field
  ‘ground truthing’. Island County does not warrant, expressed or implied, the accuracy,
  reliability, or timeliness of information in this system, and shall not be held
  liable for losses caused by using this information. Any person or entity that relies
