description: Our County Jasper County has a population of 118,596 people and owes
  its existence to the lead and zinc that was mined in the area in the late 1800s
  and early 1900s. It contains the towns of Carl Junction, Carthage, which is the
  county seat, Webb City, and Joplin, which is the 5th largest MSA in Missouri. Maps
  are how users work with and apply GIS, and can be used anywhereâ€”in web browsers,
  on smartphones and tablets, and in desktop applications. Use our County's public
  platform for exploring and downloading open data, discovering and building apps,
  and engaging to solve important local issues. Here we will provide an explanation
  on the Open Data we are sharing for our community, how to understand it, and for
  what you might use it. Together we can make a great, well-connected County! Jasper
