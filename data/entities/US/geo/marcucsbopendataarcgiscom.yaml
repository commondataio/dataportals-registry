description: '~ Maya Forest Atlas Portal ~ Landscape Geographies ~ from the Past,
  in the Present, for the Future The rediscovery of El Pilar triggered a new process
  of survey and exploration. We have created this                                                                   atlas
  on the Maya area to feature views at the regional, local, and site scales. This
  coverage goes from modern roads to ancient monuments. We invite you to explore the
  varied geographies that are the backdrop of the ancient Maya center of El Pilar
  in the Maya forest. Access the Maya Forest Atlas here Building the Maya Forest Atlas
  ~ from Hand Drawing to Digital Compilations Building the Maya Forest El Pilar was
  unknown until 1983 and the first sketches revealed large plazas, high temples, and
  massive palaces under the canopy of the Maya forest. Mapping in the 80s relied on
  archaeological traditions: pace and compass along with the transit theodolite and
  stadia rod. Our fist maps of El Pilar relied on these tried and true methods. By
  the 1990s, we upgraded to a total station transit, where we discovered that El Pilar
  spread across Belize and Guatemala. Now El Pilar is a reserve in both countries.
  In the 2000s we moved into the world of GIS, integrating our ranging local surveys
  around El Pilar and incorporating regional data for the entire Maya forest of Belize,
  Guatemala, and Mexico. Collecting and creating digital layers of topography, forest,
  LiDAR, and archaeology resulted in an archive of data that crosscut regional, local,
  and site specific themes. About Copyright © 2020 The Regents of the University of
