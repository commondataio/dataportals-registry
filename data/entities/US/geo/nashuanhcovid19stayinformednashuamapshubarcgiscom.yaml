  Photo from: gcn.com COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
  This new virus and disease were unknown to the population before the outbreak began
  in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. This page provides information, maps and resources
  about the coronavirus response in the Greater Nashua Public Health Region. The City
  of Nashua and Non-Profit Organizations serving Nashua

  are tracking volunteer hours by location. Your volunteer hours make a

  difference and will support the City in soft-match for available Federal

  Grants. Please click on the icon to the left to log each location where you volunteered,
  the number of hours

  you volunteered, and the date that you volunteered. See how Volunteer How-To Instruction

  Reported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for
  confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. The following symptoms may
  appear 2-14 days after exposure (based on previous MERS-CoV virus incubation periods).
  Source- CDC Cough with illustration of person wiping their nose Fever with illustration
  of man sweating and holding thermometer Call your doctor if you develop symptoms
  and have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19, or have recently
  traveled from an area with widespread/ongoing community spread of COVID-19. What
  You Can Do to Prevent Illness There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus
  disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed
  to this virus. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person: It may
  be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that
  has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,
  but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. Older adults and people
  who have severe underlying chronic medical conditions like heart or lung disease
  or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications
  from COVID-19 illness. Please consult with your health care provider about additional
  steps you may be able to take to protect yourself. Take Steps to Protect Yourself
  and Others Avoid close contact If

  you do have to leave your home to get food, necessary healthcare, care for a

  loved one, or go to your essential job. If

  you do have to leave your home to get food, necessary healthcare, care for a

  loved one, or go to your essential job. We encourage individuals

  who live and work in the Greater Nashua Public Health Region to stay at home,

  except for essential needs, to minimize the spread of COVID-19. What to do if you
  are sick See all steps from the CDC here Call your doctor:  If you think you have
  been exposed to COVID-19 and develop a fever and symptoms of respiratory illness,
  such as cough or difficulty breathing, call your healthcare provider immediately.
  Stay Home except to get medical care Separate yourself from other people and animals
  in your home Call ahead before visiting a doctor Cover your coughs and clean your
  hands often . Additional Coronavirus Resources CDC logo CDC Resources Frequently
  Asked Questions See also the CDC''s general COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus FAQ. What
  is a novel coronavirus? What is the source of the virus? Will warm weather stop
  the outbreak of COVID-19? What should healthcare professionals and health departments
  do? A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified.
  The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses
  that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
  A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19
  diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than
  patients with common coronavirus diagnosis. Coronaviruses are a large family of
  viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses,
  only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged
  to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred
  for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and
  Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses
  that originated from animals and then spread to people. More information about the
  source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and
  Spread of the Virus. It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact
  the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread
  more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become
  sick with these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether
  the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much
  more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated
  with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing. See the FAQ for Healthcare Professionals
  from the CDC for more information.'
