description: 'Clean Air and Climate Change in Maryland The Air and Radiation Administration
  (ARA) develops and implements programs for cleaner air. The Administration monitors
  levels of ambient air pollutants across Maryland and develops plans to achieve and
  maintain air quality standards. To control air emissions, ARA makes and enforces
  regulations and issues permits that set emission standards for construction or operation
  of equipment that emits to the atmosphere. ARA works through seven programs: Air
  Monitoring; Air Quality Compliance; Air Quality Permits; Air Quality Planning; Climate
  Change; Mobile Sources Control; and Radiological Health. Report an Air Quality Problem
  Please use the report form below to report ambient air quality problems. The Maryland
  Department of the Environment does not have the authority to investigate problems
  with indoor air like mold, odors, or cigarette smoke. Your local health department or
  code enforcement office would be a good place to start. The Department also does
  not have the authority to address emissions from airplanes or other sources that
  are regulated solely by the federal government. ARA Complaints by Type and Resolution
