  other benefits, these trees improve our air and water quality, cool our neighborhoods,
  and provide critical habitat for birds, bees, and... people, too! To help the public
  understand and connect with the forest that surrounds them, UFD has created this
  interactive portal. Scroll down to explore information describing the history, value,
