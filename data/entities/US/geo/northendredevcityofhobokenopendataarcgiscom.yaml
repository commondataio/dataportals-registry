  \ and 2/17/21 On March 3, 2021, the Hoboken City Council will vote on Second Reading\
  \ to adopt the North End Redevelopment Plan! JULY 2020 UPDATE On April 1, 2020,\
  \ the\nHoboken City Council amended the City's contract with the WRT Consulting\
  \ Team\nto perform additional special analysis requested by the City Council North\n\
  End Subcommittee to prepare and refine development scenarios and to complete\nthe\
  \ North End Redevelopment Plan.  The WRT Team has since met\n(virtually) with the\
  \ Subcommittee on several occasions and is now in the\nprocess of completing that\
  \ analysis, and finalizing the Draft Redevelopment\nPlan, which they hope to being\
  \ able to provide to the City for review and\ncomment by August 1.  After the City's\
  \ review of the Draft Plan, the WRT Team will need time to revise the Draft based\
  \ on one or more rounds of City comments.  A Refined Draft will be made available\
  \ to\nthe public before it is presented to City Council for adoption, which is\n\
  anticipated for September/October, unless the scale and breadth of comments\nrequires\
  \ a longer revision period. For more information about the public participation\
  \ process, go to \"Engage Now.\" To see the overall project schedule, go to \"Timeline.\"\
  \ THE NORTH END - A VISIONARY, RESILIENT MIXED-USE DISTRICT The North End Redevelopment\
  \ Plan offers the City of Hoboken and its residents the opportunity to collectively\
  \ re-imagine the future of the area for generations to come. The Plan will provide\
  \ a vision and a strategic approach for redevelopment that considers residents’\
  \ desire to live, work, and play in a city that is environmentally resilient, socially\
  \ equitable, and uniquely Hoboken—a historic and unique city to be celebrated. THE\
  \ NORTH END The North End Area is located in the northwestern corner of the City\
  \ and consists of approximately 30 acres bounded by the 14th Street viaduct to the\
  \ south, Park Avenue to the East, 17th Street to the north and the Palisades Cliffs\
  \ to the west; the Hudson Bergen Light Rail line runs along the western and northern\
  \ boundaries. OPPORTUNITY FOR A MIXED-USE DISTRICT In December 2013 the City Council\
  \ declared the 30.17 acres that encompasses the North End Area as an Area in Need\
  \ of Rehabilitation pursuant to the Local Redevelopment and Housing Law of the State\
  \ of New Jersey (LRHL).  That designation presents an opportunity to develop a Redevelopment\
  \ Plan that will allow Hoboken to: • Maintain and grow a diversified tax base •\
  \ Significantly upgrade its aging municipal and educational structures • Create\
  \ and support a vibrant local economy, including adding innovation uses to Hoboken\
  \ • Identify and reserve locations for future public transportation expansion •\
  \ Optimize peak period traffic and flow • Incorporate resiliency infrastructure\
  \ to protect the City from the devastation of flooding • Ensure sufficient open\
  \ space and recreation and • Encourage more affordable housing QUICK FACTS APPROACH\
  \ The North End Redevelopment Plan will be created through a transparent planning\
  \ process that engages property owners, area stakeholders, residents and city agencies\
  \ in building consensus towards an implementable vision. The planning process will\
  \ approach the redevelopment for the North End through the following lenses in order\
  \ to create - A VISIONARY, RESILIENT MIXED-USE DISTRICT. COMMUNITY •    Creates\
  \ an urban design framework and design guidelines that ensures that new development\
  \ is in keeping with the vision and character established by the plan •    Re-imagines\
  \ the North End of Hoboken for its next generation of citizens •    Utilizes creative\
  \ placemaking and branding strategies that create a sense of place and engages users\
  \ ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT •    Supports the City’s efforts to grow and maintain a diversified\
  \ tax base •    Provides tools to evaluate development opportunities and their economic\
  \ feasibility •    Attracts new uses that are currently missing in Hoboken, including\
  \ innovation economy uses •    Creates a flexible framework that is buildable and\
  \ implementable RESILIENCY •    Integrates and leverages previous and ongoing planning\
  \ efforts and investments •    Assesses district-wide strategies for water, energy\
  \ and resilient infrastructure MOBILITY •    Leverages a potential new light rail\
  \ station for a walkable, bikeable, vibrant district •    Resolves traffic and parking\
  \ issues to develop a multimodal network that leverages new transportation investments\
