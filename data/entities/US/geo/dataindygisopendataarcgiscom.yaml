description: 'OpenIndy Data Portal Disclose Indy Browse Data by Category A Message
  from Mayor Joe Hogsett A resource for scholars, entrepreneurs and interested citizens.
  Explore the following categories to find administrative, environmental, and unstructured
  data sets. Data is an essential resource that can help our society run more efficiently
  and more effectively. The data available through this portal spans every categoryâ€”from
  education to crime to transportation and land use. At the city and county level
  we continue to integrate such data into our administrative processes in order to
  make informed and targeted decisions and policies. Through tools like this, we invite
  you, the scholar, developer, and citizen, to help us build knowledge and govern
  transparently. Mayor Joe Hogsett The OpenIndy Data Portal contains all data required
  by Disclose Indy, a plan to promote honesty, integrity, and cost savings in local
  government. The Disclose Indy ordinance ensures public access to the following information:
  city or county contracts, ethics filings, campaign finance reports, crime statistics,
  community resources, budget and spending information, audits, and any other documents
  or information deemed appropriate by the Office of Corporation Counsel.'
