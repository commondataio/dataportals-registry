description: "NC OneMap Geographic Data Serving a Statewide Community NC OneMap is\
  \ a strategic resource providing a collection of authoritative data and web services.\
  \ It is an organized effort of numerous partners throughout North Carolina, involving\
  \ local, state, and federal government agencies, the private sector and academia.\
  \ Search for or browse the data, use it in your applications, analyze it with your\
  \ tools, or build apps using the APIs. Featured Web Apps Use these simple apps to\
  \ dive into some of the most popular data from NC OneMap. Property Image Seamlines\
  \ Addresses Browse statewide parcel information with standardized attributes. Find\
  \ collection dates for all imagery from the NC Orthoimagery Program. Browse and\
  \ download address points for all 100 counties. Direct Data Downloads Immediate\

  \ internet access for North Carolina. Browse parcels from the mountains to the coast.\
  \ Learn more about Next Generation 911. Browse addresses from top to bottom. Funded\
  \ by the NC911 Board, the NC Orthoimagery Program collects high-resolution orthophotography\
  \ for a quarter of the state each year. This imagery can be used as a background\
  \ for maps and visualizations or as a reference to create data such as buildings,\
  \ roads, or open spaces - virtually anything visible in the image. Mapping broadband\
  \ in North Carolina identifies current access and adoption. This allows state and\
  \ local governments to dedicate resources necessary for economic development, closing\
  \ the homework gap, and enhancing emergency communications. Accurate mapping ensures\
  \ that funding is targeted to areas in need. The NC Parcels project transforms parcel\
  \ data from all 100 counties and the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians into a\
  \ statewide data set with standardized attributes.\n              Parcels supports\
  \ a number of key industries such as economic development and emergency management.\
  \ NC DIT and the 911 Board are working to bring NG911 to North Carolina, featuring\
  \ the ability to send emergency responders directly to the 911 caller's exact location,\
  \ even if the person is calling or texting with from cell phone. There are multiple\
  \ benefits to this technology and GIS plays a role. A standardized addressing solution\
  \ that completes a full circle flow of information from county and local government\
  \ providers through Next Generation 911. Address NC integrates and adds value to\
  \ statewide assets such as parcels, building footprints, and municipal boundaries.\
