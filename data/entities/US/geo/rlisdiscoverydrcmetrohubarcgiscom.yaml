description: "RLIS Discovery RLIS Discovery Regional Land Information System Since\
  \ the inception of the Regional Land Information System (RLIS) in the late 1980s,\
  \ Metro’s Data Resource Center staff have worked with regional partners to collect\
  \ and combine a wide array of data into a seamless dataset for use in regional decision-making.\
  \ RLIS Live, first published in 1996, is the data that are regularly updated and\
  \ available to download or access as web services. The work of Metro’s regional\
  \ partners and data contributors ensures that RLIS Live data is current and accurate.\
  \ Use of RLIS data implies acceptance of Metro's Terms of Use policy. Browse RLIS\
  \ data View all of the open data in the RLIS Live catalog, including taxlots, streets,\
  \ transit, zoning, jurisdictional boundaries, addresses, rivers, and more. Download\
  \ the data in a variety of formats, view it in a web map, or learn more by reviewing\
  \ the metadata. Most RLIS data is updated quarterly, and some items are updated\
  \ on a weekly basis. Legacy users: please log in to your account using the Sign\
