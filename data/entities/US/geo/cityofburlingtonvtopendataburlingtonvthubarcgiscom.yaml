description: Welcome to the City of Burlington’s Data Hub What is BTVstat? Data’s
  greatest value comes from having it freely shared among government agencies, researchers,
  developers and the public while safeguarding privacy and security. We invite you
  to explore the data, create maps and charts, or build apps using our APIs. In addition
  to maintaining open data, Mayor Weinberger implemented BTVstat in 2016, a performance
  management program to review operational and equity performance metrics for different
  City Departments, identify challenges, track progress, control costs, and promote
  accountability, learning, and collaboration. Highlights from these BTVstat presentations
  are included in information below. Burlington at a Glance Want to learn more about
