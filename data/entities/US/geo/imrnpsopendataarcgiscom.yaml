  \ | Texas | Utah | Wyoming Data Categories IRMA Portal The Integrated Resource Management\
  \ Applications (IRMA) Portal is a web-based \"one-stop\" for data and information\
  \ related to National Park Service natural and cultural resources. From IRMA you\
  \ can search for, view, and download documents, reports, publications, data sets,\
  \ and park species lists. You can get information on park visitor numbers, park\
  \ projects, and apply for a park research permit. Featured Maps All maps tell a\
  \ story, whether it be a trend, pattern, relationship, issue, event, or some other\
  \ tale. The National Park Service has enhanced its stories through the creation\
  \ of\n                story maps. Story maps combine spatial data with multimedia\
  \ content (such as text, photos, video, and\n                audio) into an elegant\
  \ user experience."
