description: 'Malaga A Smart City Students from the West Chester University of Pennsylvania''s
  Spring 2019 Planning and Design Studio worked with the city of Malaga, Spain to
  encourage community engagement and create sustainable and innovative developmental
  plans using cutting edge GIS technology.  The Planning and Design studio traveled
  abroad for two weeks working closely with city officials and others stakeholders
  (listed below). We have taken on a series of projects around the city, based off
  of Malaga''s wants and needs including growing green and smart city philosophies.
  The main goals of the Studio projects were redevelopment, historic and environmental
  preservation, and community engagement. When scrolling below, notice the use of
  the University''s 3D models to make planning decisions easier and StoryMaps that
  make community engagement more accessible. WCU''s Planning Studio Story Map Stakeholders
  Luis Medina-Montoya Hellgren Projects Special projects created through collaboration
  between the City of Malaga and students of West Chester University. El Ejido Historically
  the site of a common meadow for the city''s cattle to graze, and more recently,
  the former home of the University of Malaga, this neighborhood is now slated for
  redevelopment. These historic blocks are now planned to be an area for municipal
  and community work. The first step in redevelopment is defining the study area which
  has been done in two ways. First, by mapping El Ejido in CityEngine, we can show
  the height and character of the varied building types. Adding the surrounding buildings
  and making the study area blue gives a good scope of the neighborhood from above.
  Secondly, El Ejido has again been modeled in ArcGIS Pro. This model has been textured
  with real life facades and roofs to better understand the types of buildings. Both
  are used to define and better understand the study area. Learn More 3D CityEngine
  Model of El Ejido Here El Ejido is shown as a 3D model using a scenario based modeling
  software, CityEngine. This model is clickable, movable, and completely interactive
  to any user. Check out the tutorial on how to navigate our CityEngine model below!
  3D ArcGIS Pro Web Scene of El Ejido This web scene provides an interactive analysis
  of our study area. Sunlight analysis and distance measuring are two tools that can
  be used by planners to further their understanding of the space. Check out the tutorial
  on how to navigate our ArcGIS Pro web scene below! Aerial view of El Ejido El Ejido
  Re-Imagined A story map, El Ejido Re-Imagined, was created to analyze the relationship
  between the community and the study area. Currently natural and man made barriers
  create a disconnect, open and green spaces are deteriorating, and murals and public
  work spaces are absent. Our story map presents ideas and opportunities to revive
  El Ejido and connect it to the surrounding neighborhoods. Main Entrance to El Ejido
  Neighborhood Gibralfaro One of the oldest and most protected areas of the city,
  Castillo Gibralfaro, a Phoenician fortification dating back to 770 B.C, is a unique
  location to visit just steps outside the city center. With the ideas of historic
  and environmental preservation in mind, we have created two models. First, we have
  modeled the castle walls leaving out the buildings for emphasis on their architectural
  beauty. Elevation has been added to show just how important, yet difficult, it is
  to manage these ancient walls that sit on eroding steep slopes. It is also important
  to take into account the large volume of tourist traffic they receive everyday.
  3D ArcGIS Pro Model of Gibralfaro This historic site is shown as a 3D model using
  a scenario based modeling software, ArcGIS Pro. This allows people to see the elevation
  of Gibralfaro and allows for proper preservation of the area. Open Data Maps Explore

  City of Malaga Integrates the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals What
  is a smart city? A smart city is a designation given to a city that incorporates
  information and communication technologies to enhance the quality and performance
  of urban services such as energy, transportation, and utilities in order to reduce
  resource consumption, wastage and costs. Malaga is a premier smart city that is
  recognized worldwide. Smart City Malaga Living Lab is the ecosystem of innovation
  that we have developed in Malaga. It represents a huge step forward in experimenting
  with and showing the solutions that will serve to build the cities of the future.
  The objective is to achieve the most complete analysis and feasible conclusions
  to face the challenges of the present and future in a model city with great possibilities.
  The Sustainable Development Goals are the blueprint to achieve a better and more
  sustainable future for all. They address the global challenges we face, including
  those related to poverty, inequality, climate, environmental degradation, prosperity,
  and peace and justice. In March, Malaga hosted Green Cities 2019, an international
  forum and meeting for municipalities, businesses, and professionals focused on sustainable
  smart cities. Malaga has demonstrated its green city commitment to ensure the quality
  of public transport and energy efficiency projects by adopting a new new strategic
  plan that includes 200 projects and a 155 million euro budget. Notable large scale
  projects include: 1.) zero energy balance

  , 2.) water management and smart waste management, 3.) sustainable transport, and
  4.) artificial intelligence to reduce traffic congestion. The two videos below show
  Malaga''s current and future sustainable goals. Below are two videos from the City
  of Malaga that do a wonderful job of visualizing their 2030 sustainable goals and
  projects. Find Data Transportation Community Recreation Education West Chester University

  to produce geographer and planners conceptually and technically skilled for spatial
  analysis and problem-solving. WCU Studio Students Work Session West Chester University
  Planning Studio students develop proficiency in GIS, site planning and urban design
  techniques. The goal of a studio course is to challenge students to integrate planning, 
  geography, prior academic work, and their real life experiences into one studio
  project. The studio requires understanding of urban and suburban life in response
  to a real-world project that spans detailed data collection, analysis, development
  and presentation of appropriate planning goals, recommendations, policies, concepts,
  plans and designs at either a regional, local, or site-specific scale. Examples:
