  \ by phone in the following languages. Phone lines are open every day from 7am to\
  \ 2am Eastern Time. For information on services for people who are deaf or hard\
  \ of hearing: Call the TDD number at 844-467-2020. What is the Census and Why Does\
  \ it Matter for Hudson County? New Jersey receives approximately  $2,500 per person\
  \ in federal funds for programs tied to the Census. That means an undercount of\
  \ Hudson County residents could mean hundreds of millions of dollars lost over 10\
  \ years. These programs include but are not limited to the following: The Census\
  \ is used in redrawing election districts every ten years. This determines what\
  \ election district you live in and who represents your interests at all levels\
  \ of government. Each Congressional district should be represented by an equal population\
  \ total, however, the only way to ensure fair and equal representation is when an\
  \ accurate count is achieved. Census data plays a role in allowing all types of\
  \ organizations to be more efficient and successful. Without the Census, we would\
  \ not be able to properly plan for our current and, most importantly, our future\
  \ needs. Groups which use data collected by the Census include:\nGovernment Agencies\
  \ Utilities\nUniversities\nNon-Profit Organizations\nPrivate Businesses The Census\
  \ determines how many representatives each state has in the United States Congress.\
  \ New Jersey has lost two seats since 1990 as a result of the Census; once in 1993\
  \ and again in 2003. We now only have 12 representatives in the House of Representatives\
  \ today; the lowest number since 1933. This limits the state’s influence on the\
  \ federal budget, federal policy and our ability to bring back funds to our state.\
