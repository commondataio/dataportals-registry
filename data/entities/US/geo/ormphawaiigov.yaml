description: The 2020 Hawai‘i Ocean Resources Management Plan Dashboard Indicators
  of Coastal Zone Health from Mauka to Makai Aloha kākou! Welcome! Through partnerships
  and a transparent statewide approach, we can sustainably manage our coastal resources
  of cultural, economic, and environmental importance from mauka to makai (mountain
  to sea). The Hawaiʻi Ocean Resources Management Plan (ORMP) tracks implementation
  progress demonstrated by the collaborative efforts showcased under three Focus Areas
  and five Management Priorities. Quantitative and Qualitative metrics are also captured
  in this Dashboard as indicators of coastal zone health and agency investment. Focus
  Areas Based on input from the public and agency partners, three Focus Areas emerged
  in the 2020 ORMP. These Focus Areas reflect the interconnectedness of mauka to makai
  planning. Learn more about how the Focus Areas were determined on page 29 of the
  ORMP or on the ORMP Overview. Focus Area IILand-Based Pollution Polluted stormwater
  runoff is a pervasive and widespread issue that degrades coastal habitats and threatens
  human health. Focus Area IIIMarine Ecosystems Supporting efforts towards effective
  management of Hawaiʻi's nearshore waters for healthy reefs, fish, and communities.
  Management Priorities Management Priorities apply broadly to all of the Focus Areas
  and generally mirror the Coastal Zone Management Program's coastal zone management
  law objectives and policies (HRS § 205A-2). These Priorities serve as one way to
  monitor agency compliance and to document ongoing actions that demonstrate consistency
  with the ORMP framework. Management Priorities Ocean Economy | Cultural Heritage
  of the Ocean | Training, Education, and AwarenessCollaboration and Conflict Resolution
  | Community and Place-Based Ocean Management CZM Network The CZM Program employs
  a wide variety of regulatory and non-regulatory techniques to address coastal issues
  and uphold environmental law through a cooperative framework that statutorily includes
  State, University, county, and community representation, with collaboration by Federal
  agencies. OPSD-CZM coordinates ORMP implementation which is administered through
  this CZM network of partners from public health, transportation, land and natural
  resources, defense, agriculture departments, and more. CZM Network Partners
