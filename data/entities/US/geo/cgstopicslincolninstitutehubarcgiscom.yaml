description: Center for Geospatial Solutions Data Topics Hub The Center for Geospatial
  Solutions (CGS) at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy offers inclusive access
  to powerful tools and technologies that can help people to extract more and better
  insights from data. We partner with diverse organizations and individuals that seek
  equitable solutions to climate change, habitat loss, water scarcity, and other challenges
  that threaten the quality of life for all people. Geospatial technology enables
  users to combine and analyze data sets to understand complex interactions and decide
  where and how to act. This hub is a curated collection that includes many geospatial
  datasets, maps, and applications that are freely available all in one location.
