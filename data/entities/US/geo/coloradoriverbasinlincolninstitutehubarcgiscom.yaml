description: Colorado River Basin GIS Open Data Portal Connecting People and Data
  The Babbitt Center for Land and Water Policy, a center of the Lincoln Institute
  of Land Policy, presents the Colorado River Basin GIS Open Data Platform for sharing
  and downloading open-source GIS data from The Hardest Working River in the West,
  a StoryMap exploring the Colorado River Through Data. This Open Data Portal hosts
  GIS data, maps, and reports referenced and shared in the StoryMap. Explore Data,

  River Basin Interactive Map and Dashboard Secure Our Water Future Weather extremes
  are the new normal. Climate change is undeniable. A bright and sustainable future
  in the West requires that we integrate land and water policy decisions. The Babbitt
  Center for Land and Water Policy is working to secure our water future. Water is
  the lifeblood of the American West. Land use decisions are made every day that shape
  our water future. Coordination of land and water use decisions is critical if we
  are to meet the current and future water needs of our people, economy, and environment.
  Recognizing the important connection between land and water issues, the Lincoln
  Institute of Land Policy established the Babbitt Center for Land and Water Policy
  in 2017. The Babbitt Center’s current focus is the Colorado River region, which
  is dependent on one of the most heavily used and over allocated rivers in the world.
  Featured Work Incorporating Water into Comprehensive Planning Guidance Manual The
  Babbitt Center for Land and Water Policy authored a manual to help land use planners
  incorporate water management into comprehensive plans. The comprehensive plan and
  its development process provide an opportunity for a community to bring goals and
  policies for water issues to the forefront of their future vision, solicit public
  input, and foster public buy-in for a more sustainable future. This manual demonstrates
  how land use planners can facilitate a comprehensive planning process and resulting
  plan that will ensure integration of water management into their community’s future
  vision, as well as the water-related topics such a vision might include. Incorporating
  Water Into Comprehensive Planning Guidance Manual The Hardest Working River in the
  West A StoryMap Exploring the Colorado River Through Data This StoryMap is an introductory
  survey of the situation, a primer organized around some of today's key challenges
  for managing the Colorado River for all, highlighting the data and stories behind
  the state of lands, waters, and uses of both from the ever-diminishing flows of
  the Colorado River. This Story was developed in conjunction with Phase I of the
  Babbitt Center Land-Water Indicators Project. This project focuses on developing
  sets of indicators useful for communicating information in the context of the Colorado
  River Basin to policy-makers, resource managers, and other stakeholders. These indicators
  will be primarily focused on outcomes and documenting the state of land and water
  resources in the Basin. The Hardest Working River in the West - A StoryMap Exploring
