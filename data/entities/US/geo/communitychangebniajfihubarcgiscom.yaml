description: "Exploring a decade of neighborhood evolution in Baltimore, 2010 to 2020\
  \ Research from the Baltimore Community Change project shows that our neighborhoods\
  \ are diverging apart. We live in a dual-reality of \"Two Baltimores\" where some\
  \ neighborhoods are growing and getting all kinds of resources, but others are not.\
  \ We, as a city, cannot afford — not ethically, psychologically, \nor financially\
  \ — “enduring divergence” (to keep pulling apart) if we want a \nmore just and equitable\
  \ future for Baltimore. \"This work should empower us to take action to stop population\
  \ loss and eliminate neighborhood disparities in Baltimore\" Explore the Data and\
  \ Maps Demographics Housing Diversity Housing Occupancy Accessibility Connectivity\

  \ In this interactive visualization, explore the changes in Baltimore's communities\
  \ across all indicators we are tracking. Explore our community change interactive\
  \ maps! In this portfolio collection, explore the changes in Baltimore's communities\
  \ as detailed in our research briefs. About The goal of this effort is for neighborhood\
  \ residents, organizations, and other stakeholders to use data and the Vital Signs\
  \ report to strategically and effectively foster new ways of thinking about improving\
  \ our City, neighborhoods, and government over time. Through this work, BNIA has\
  \ had the privilege and unique vantage point of having a veritable stethoscope on\
  \ all of Baltimore’s neighborhoods, which has enabled us to identify 4 goals for\
  \ neighborhoods towards a more just and equitable city. Every neighborhood needs\
  \ (housing) diversity, occupancy, accessibility, and connectivity. In August 2021,\
  \ the U.S. Census Bureau released its P.L. 94-171 \nRedistricting data, a first\
  \ look at small-geography population counts \nfrom the 2020 Census. So far, the\
  \ results for Baltimore City are \ndiscouraging. Overall, the City lost 5.7% of\
  \ its total population from \n2010 to 2020. The current population, 585,708, is\
  \ the lowest population \nin a century. However, population change is not uniform\
  \ across the City. With the latest release of Vital Signs 19/20 in Spring \n2021,\
  \ we have seen some positive news built on years of residents, \npublic agencies,\
  \ businesses, and civic institutions helping to keep \nBaltimore resilient. Baltimore\
  \ City Population Change, 2000-2020 None of these positive trends happened overnight,\
  \ nor did they \ninvolve any one solution. Perhaps, the greatest lesson learned\
  \ for all \nof us is that when Baltimore comes together to solve a problem, we can\
