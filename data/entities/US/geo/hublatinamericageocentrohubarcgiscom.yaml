description: 'Welcome to C2M2 Latin America HUB The Latin America HUB will focus on
  the spatial analysis and

  visualization of redistribution of poverty and other emergent processes related

  to it. Specifically, will focus on the processes related to migration/mobility

  and the multiplicative effects of the collapse of tourism in different cities.

  The HUB will focus on short- and long-term migrants, especially migrants from

  Venezuela and urban dwellers, which arrived recently to large cities from rural

  areas. Additionally, the collapse of tourism will allow to explore the

  distributive and multiplicative impact of the pandemics. Explore Geospatially Referenced
  Data by Category This section makes data of the C2M2 project Indicators database
  readily available as geospatial data web services, suitable for the production of
  maps and other data visualizations and analyses, and easy to download in multiple
  formats Partners Purpose of C2M2 Latin America HUB The Latin

  America HUB focused on understanding the second-order impacts of COVID-19,

  mainly, identifying disruptions in the local socio-economic dynamics in some

  cities of Ecuador, Chile, Per√∫ and Brazil. The goal of this project is to

  analyze processes related to migration/mobility, violence and the

  multiplicative effects of the collapse of tourism in different cities through

  spatio-temporal analysis and modeling. The HUB collect data about short- and

  long-term migrants, particularly, migrants from Venezuela and urban dwellers

  that arrived recently from rural areas. Furthermore, the collapse of tourism

  and the increase or decrease of violence will allow to explore the distributive

  and multiplicative impact of the pandemic. Dashboards and Apps About us The USFQ
  Institute of Geography has been created to generate scientific knowledge of environmental,
  socioeconomic, and biophysical processes. Thus, it creates relevant evidence for
  public policies, individual and social action for the conservation of ecosystems
  and the well-being of populations. The main objectives of the institute are:'
