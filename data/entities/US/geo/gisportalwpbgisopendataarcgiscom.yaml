  forward in City’s commitment to transparency The City of West Palm Beach has adopted
  an open data policy as part of the City’s larger commitment to transparency and
  collaboration with residents. The policy establishes a framework for proactively
  publishing municipal data and lays the groundwork for West Palm Beach to drive decision-making
  with municipal metrics. The West Palm Beach data effort creates a new space for
  City decision makers to meet and review metrics and, also, enables conversation
  on the quality and value of City data. Not only will City data become more available
  for internal and external uses but also the information can be used in future performance
  analytics projects. City West Palm Beach Open Data Policy Use this platform to search
  for, view, and download spatial data in a variety of formats. The data is available
  for download as CSV, KML, Shapefile, and accessible via web services to support
  application development and data visualization. The City of West Palm Beach invites
  you to browse the data, download it as a file, analyze it with your tools, or build

  The  Homeless Activity Reporter is a web-based tool that allows residents and homeless
  individuals to document when and where help is needed. “The Homeless Activity Reporter
  is one of many tactics being implemented in our city to address the issue of homelessness,”
  said West Palm Beach Mayor Keith A. James. “This technology will help us to better
  connect the homeless with much needed programs and services while, at the same time,
  giving residents a voice in addressing neighborhood concerns. This is one of the
  ways we are working to improve the quality of life for all residents.” Read latest
