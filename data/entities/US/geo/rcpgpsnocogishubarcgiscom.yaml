description: Puget Sound RCPGP Hub Discover data, forms, tools, other resources for
  regional partners Puget Sound Regional Catastrophic Grant Program (2019-2022) Snohomish
  County received a Regional Catastrophic Grant in 2019 as part of a 3 year grant
  program. The County is leading a Regional effort of 8 Counties and 7 cities, in
  collaboration with the State of Washington Emergency Management Division, FEMA Region
  10, and various public and private industry partners to assess transportation damage
  after a 9.0 magnitude Cascadia Subduction Zone quake and determine the population
  impacts of such an event. This site is under construction and will be actively updated
  as the project develops. USGS Cascadia Subduction Zone The 2019 RCPGP Project will
  analyze the results of a simulated 9.0 magnitude rupture of the Cascadia Subduction
  Zone across an 8 County Puget Sound region, and its impacts on the transportation
  system, the supply chain of goods and supplies, and population mobility. The results
  of this analysis will feed decisions on where to provide viable Community Points
  of Distribution, or CPODs, throughout the 8 County Region, where life sustaining
  goods and supplies will be distributed after a major seismic event. The analysis
  will also include estimates of which areas of population may remain isolated longer
  than others, and where long term CPOD operations may be needed. Additionally, the
  project will bring together public and private maritime industry members to discuss
  how the region's waterways can be utilized to ship large goods and supplies to distribution
  hubs where they can serve the CPODs. The Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) is a 700
  mile subduction zone that generally runs N-S off of the North American West Coast
  from Cape Mendocino, CA to Brooks Peninsula, BC, where the Juan de Fuca and Gorda
  oceanic plates converge with the North America continental plate at an approximate
  20 mile depth. A rupture of this fault could create a significant seismic event,
  historically between 8.0 - 9.0 magnitude on the seismic scale. The last rupture
  of the CSZ occurred in the year 1700, and was estimated by geologists to have been
  between a magnitude 8.7 and 9.0 in scale, along 620 miles of fault line. The average
  upward thrust of that event was 66 feet, which created a major seismic disturbance
  across the region, including tsunamis linked to the event on the Washington coast
  and in Japan. The entire fault could rupture as one large event, or rupture section
  by section over a period of years. Coastline displacement of up to 6.6 feet in elevation
  could occur, possibly triggering tsunamis in multiple locations along the Pacific
  Ocean coastlines. Additional damage could occur based on the shaking intensity,
  especially in areas with soils prone to liquefaction or landslides. Intense shaking
  at this magnitude is expected to cause major infrastructure damage to buildings,
  highways, railways and bridges, which could create 'Population Islands" where mobility
  outside of the immediate area may be significantly limited, or not possible, delaying
  or inhibiting a return trip for many people to their homes and reunification with
  loved ones. The RCPGP project will analyze the infrastructure impacts of a M9.0
  CSZ event, and assess where these Population Islands may occur, and the viability
  of selected CPOD sites to serve each population island. The project will also assess
  the capacity of the CPOD sites, and determine based on prioritized transportation
  routes, where CPODs may be needed on a longer term basis. Subduction zones occur
  where tectonic plates converge, when one or more plates slides beneath another plate,
  subducting into the Earth's mantle. Subduction Zone plates may become stuck at shallow
  depths, building up and storing stress along the fault line. When this pressure
  breaks free, the fault slips, releasing the energy in a megathrust event, producing
  some of the largest earthquakes on Earth. These large seismic events can also create
  tsunamis when the seafloor moves vertically, or drops, displacing a massive amount
  of water. The Washington State Department of Natural Resources has produced a Tsunami
  Simulation of a 9.0 rupture of the Cascadia Subduction Zone available on You Tube.
