description: "GIS Services ALBANY, NEW YORK What is GIS? Geographic Information Systems\
  \ (GIS) is a broad term that has grown in both definition and applicability for\
  \ over five decades—and it doesn't plan on stopping any time soon.  Given that GIS\
  \ is now integrated into much of what we do and how we live, it is no surprise that\
  \ if you ask ten different users what GIS means, that you get ten different answers.\
  \ Overall, GIS provides a means for us to manage and analyze our information, interpret\
  \ patterns and trends, and make calculations that help us visualize a solution. \
  \ Interactive web maps and applications connect your data with a latitude and longitude,\
  \ and take that visual representation a step further by becoming a tool for decision\
  \ making, problem solving, storytelling or wayfinding. Sounds high-tech?  Not really,\
  \ you are already using GIS on a daily basis whether you know it or not—from finding\
  \ a nearby restaurant on Google maps, or 'checking-in' on facebook, to finding a\
  \ new home in a new neighborhood, or following the onset of a severe storm event. \
  \ So, what is GIS?  We think the best way to answer that question, is to simply\
  \ just show you!  Enjoy exploring Albany's GIS Hub. Search Albany Visit MapGeo®,\
  \ the City’s interactive GIS tax parcel viewer, integrating descriptive real property\
  \ information and local resources with Google Map functionality.  Search your address\
  \ to preview your property record card with descriptive details like, assessment\
  \ value, parcel size, police engagement zones or trash day. What's my Zoning?  Do\
  \ I live in an Historic District?  Turn on the map Themes to find out.  And because\
  \ it's Google-based, zoom in and take a virtual tour using Google Street View; click\
  \ on bus stops for route schedules; get driving directions; create custom maps to\
