  Added! Freshwater Partners Yellowstone River Post Flood Aerial Photo Viewer (Sept
  2022, Gardiner to Livingston) This application displays aerial photos collected
  along the Yellowstone River from approximately Gardiner to Livingston.  The photos
  were collected for post-flood (spring 2022) recovery efforts.  The flight was completed
  during the last week of September 2022, after the water had dropped and the smoke
  had completely cleared.  Properties of flood affected landowners that expressed
  interest, as well as public infrastructure, were targeted. The aerial photos were
  collected by Chris Boyer (Kestrel Aerial Services, Inc.) for Montana Freshwater
  Partners, with funding from AMB West. Flood Hub Introduction and Webinar demo/training:
