  New flood hazard data and mapping has been developed in many areas of the State,
  and are now available on this site to be viewed as PROPOSED PRELIMINARY flood risk
  mapping.  This is shared in advance of the Federal Due-Process PRELIMINARY flood
  risk mapping release. Our goal is to have local agreement and acceptance of the
  updated data, in order to minimize appeals submitted which would delay making the
  mapping effective for insurance and floodplain management purposes. If you see a
  flood risk mapped area that you think is incorrect, we ask that you submit a comment
  and explain why you think it is in error. If you have scientific/technical data
  that supports your comment, please provide that so we can review it, and if necessary,
  update the data/mapping prior to the official PRELIMINARY release. Even if you do
  not possess any technical data we welcome your review comments. View, Analyze, and
  Comment on the Proposed Data Explore Other Services Related to Floodplain Data Visit

  National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is redesigning its risk rating by

  leveraging industry best practices and current technology.  FEMA will

  deliver rates that are fair, make sense, are easier to understand, and better

  reflect a property’s unique flood risk. The NFIP is developing Risk Rating 2.0 to

  deliver the following key benefits to policyholders, communities, and the flood

  insurance industry: ·       Creates an individualized picture of a

  property’s risk ·       Provides rates that are easier to understand

  for agents and policyholders ·       Reflects more types of flood risk in rates
  ·       Uses the latest actuarial practices to set

  risk-based rates ·       Reduces complexity for agents to generate a

  quote Risk Rating 2.0 goes into

  effect nationwide on October 1, 2021. Visit FEMA Risk Rating 2.0 Contact Contact
