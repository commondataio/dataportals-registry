description: 'The Sun Cloud is a data portal for sharing transportation and socioeconomic
  data describing the Sun Corridor megaregion. Get started with the Sun Cloud Explorer
  app or the Map and Data page. The Arizona Sun Cloud Data Portal is a repository
  for transportation and socioeconomic datasets for the Sun Corridor region which
  includes Cochise, Maricopa, Pima, Pinal, and Santa Cruz counties. More than your
  average database, the Portal incorporates unique equity, broadband, access, safety,
  environmental, and mobility datasets to help communities of all sizes in the Sun
  Cloud megaregion make meaningful transportation decisions. Particularly, for small/medium-sized
  communities with limited staff, the Portal reduces workloads, removes barriers to
  data/technology, and provides access to rich data. Tools within the portal help
  streamline needs assessment, generate performance metrics, and aid in prioritizing
  needs using a customizable set of scoring criteria. The Sun Corridor is projected
  to be among the fastest growing of the twenty megapolitan regions in the United
  States over the next thirty years. The megaregion’s 2022 population of 6.3 million
  people represents approximately 85 percent of Arizona’s residents and is expected
  to increase by another 40% by 2050, creating extraordinary demands on the corridor’s
  infrastructure and natural resources. Benefits The Sun Cloud portal strengthens
  regional alignment and planning for smart infrastructure investments to improve
  mobility and safety in the fast-growing Sun Corridor megaregion. The Sun Cloud is
  used to enhance the work that supports transportation planning efforts and access
  to socioeconomic data. Strengthening the megaregional planning process saves money,
  improves outcomes, and fosters the coordination of diverse priorities more effectively.
  The Sun Cloud improves the accessibility, usability, and quality of data and analytical
  tools that are vital to transportation planning. How to Access the Sun Cloud Explorer
  Portal? Access the Sun Cloud Explorer Analysis Tool The Sun Cloud Explorer serves
  as the gateway to access the Sun Cloud Portal data and tools. The SCE provides an
  interactive and user-friendly experience to access high-quality transportation planning
  data layers and tools for the Sun Corridor region. https://suncloud.azgeo.az.gov/
  For more tips on getting started, view the 5-Minute Sun Cloud Explorer Overview
  Video. Using the Sun Cloud Explorer The Sun Cloud Explorer interface primarily includes
  a Map pane to the right and a Table of Contents pane on the left. The TOC pane includes
  three tabs – -    Layers (Screenshot # 1): Layers tab provides access to the Sun
  Cloud data layers that can be display one layer at a time or multiple layers at
  a time. -    Filters (Screenshot #2): Filters tab allows the users to further customize
  the data displayed in the map pane using predefined jurisdictional boundaries or
  data attributes. -    Scoring (Screenshots # 3 and 4): The scoring tab includes
  unique tools that allows the users to perform needs assessment of infrastructure,
  generate performance metrics, and prioritize needs using a customizable set of scoring
  criteria. The scoring tab also includes a Needs Dashboard. Screenshot # 1: Layers
