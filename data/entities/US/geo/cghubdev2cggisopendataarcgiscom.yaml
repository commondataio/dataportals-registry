description: "Coral Gables Smart City Journey The City of Coral Gables promotes the\
  \ development of a smart city ecosystem that fosters innovation and economic growth\
  \ by bringing together through technology People, Businesses, Organizations, Things,\
  \ and Systems. By leveraging strategic planning and innovation, the City’s digital\
  \ transformation and smart initiatives benefit citizens with continuous improvement\
  \ of customer service and quality of life. \nOur smart city journey is defined by\
  \ the components of transparency, value creation, digital equity, open data, business\
  \ intelligence, actionable information, governance, efficiencies, citizen engagement,\
  \ mobility, accessibility, inclusion, crowdsourcing, and collaboration. It begins\
  \ with a clear vision of excellence and charts a strategic, practical, systematic,\
  \ collaborative, and innovative roadmap that embraces the state of the art and leverages\
  \ the exponential technologies from the 4th Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0)\
  \ with a quality-of-life focus (Quality 4.0).\nOur journey to become a smarter city\
  \ starts with understanding the needs and priorities of our community. We augment\
  \ institutional knowledge and public input from traditional methods of participation\
  \ with modern technology tools to engage our citizens in a co-creative process and\
  \ listen to their voice. Today, that includes digital surveys and citizen engagement\
  \ portals, social networks, customer relationship apps, public kiosks, and most\
  \ recently, artificial intelligence and machine learning applied to public sentiment\
  \ analytics. We use this insight as input to make our smart city plans and programs\
  \ more effective, consensual, inclusive, and collaborative, as part of a periodic\
  \ elicitation cycle to gather business requirements from our constituents and our\
  \ City’s leadership. The City of Coral Gables promotes the development of a smart\

  \ Strategic Plan The City of Coral Gables Information Technology Department (CGIT)\
  \ works together with the city’s leadership and all city departments and offices\
  \ as a key strategic partner bringing value, efficiencies, and process improvements\
  \ across the organization through a significant number of technology solutions,\
  \ value-driven projects and smart city initiatives that benefit the city and its\
  \ constituents. We also help City departments achieve accreditation and compliance\
  \ with federal, state, county, city and industry standards, best practices, rules\
  \ and regulations for information governance, security, public safety, sustainability,\
  \ environmental conservation, financial administration, business processes, and\
  \ other government controls. Technology plays an important role in many of the City’s\
  \ services and operations during normal and emergency conditions by facilitating\
  \ communication between employees, constituents, and stakeholders; by fostering\
  \ collaboration and innovation; expediting tasks, increasing productivity and operational\
  \ efficiencies; by reducing carbon footprint and assessing and managing risks; and,\
  \ by enhancing the delivery of citizen services with added value and convenience.\
  \ Technology and innovation help our City become more sustainable, resilient, and\
  \ livable.  This important role has been particularly evident during the Covid-19\
  \ pandemic, when digital technologies and the resourcefulness of our team have been\
  \ helping our organization and our constituents stay connected, safe, and productive,\
  \ while helping our community recover. Click on the link below to access the latest\
