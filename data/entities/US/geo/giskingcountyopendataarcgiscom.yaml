description: King County GIS Open Data Connecting People to Place How to use this
  site... Terms and conditions GIS stands for Geographic Information System. Any data
  that includes a location component can be GIS data. GIS data is used to make maps
  and to analyze any body of information for which location is a relevant factor.
  GIS data can reveal geographically based relationships, patterns, and trends to
  better understand neighborhoods, communities, or any real-world area and the entities
  and systems that exist and operate within its boundaries. The applications of GIS
  data are unlimited. Explore the data theme categories below or use the search bar
  above to find data that you're interested in. See visualizations of the data or
  download it in the formats that best suit your needs. Explore Data by Category Administrative

  of data layers. King County Voter Turnout by Precinct uses a "Story Map" template
  to enable users to make year-to-year comparisons. My Commute is an application that
  combines and displays live travel alert data from multiple jurisdictions. The Metro
  Transit System viewer lets online users interact with and derive added information
  from a static print map. Explore more apps Visit the King County GIS Center website
