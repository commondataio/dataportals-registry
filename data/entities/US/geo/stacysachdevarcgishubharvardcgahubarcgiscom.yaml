description: 'Stacy Sachdev ArcGIS Hub This page is intended to provide you with an
  introduction to Stacy Sachdev, P.E. and to show-case the capabilities and learning
  achieved during the Spring Term (2020) at Harvard University in CSCI-8 (WebGIS,
  instructed by ESRI Subject Matter Expert: Pinde Fu) Stacy Sachdev Introduction:
  Currently I am a registered Professional Engineer (Commonwealth of Kentucky) serving
  as the Senior Manager for Process Engineering at Waste Management (HQ: Houston,
  TX).  My responsibilities are tied to engineering, construction and procurement
  data and the understanding and representation of that data to determine continuous
  improvement opportunities with respect to WM-Landfill Construction projects.  I
  am also concurrently an admitted masters degree candidate at Harvard University
  (Extension Studies: Sustainability &amp; Environmental Management) on-track for
  graduation December 2020.  This course (WebGIS) is a skill-set elective which has
  proved very useful for me professionally. Highlighted Accomplishments Throughout
  the Spring Term the CSCI-8 students experienced weekly (or bi-weekly in some cases)
  assignments.  These assignments were meant to allow theory and concept to be tested
  in application.  Assignments 1 thru 9 are provided below along with hyperlinks to
  the final outputs of each assignment. Immediately below, however, are three stand-out
  products which I developed while fulfilling the requirements for these Assignments.
  Product #1 The Survey to the immediate right was designed for Landfill Gas Construction
  work within our active site landfills in WM. Safety, Quality and Schedule were KPIs
  surveyed for our construction contractors. Product #2 The interactive Story Map
  to the right was developed as a multimedia, interactive experience to shed light
  on Female unemployment. Product #3 An interactive Time-Series animation of the count
  of global COVID-19 cases by Country (data sourced from John Hopkins University)
