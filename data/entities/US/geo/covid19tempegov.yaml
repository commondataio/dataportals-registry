description: "For the most current data and information on wastewater testing for\
  \ COVID-19, please go to https://wastewater.tempe.gov/pages/biomarker-covid19. The\
  \ City of Tempe invites you to share in this innovation journey with the evolving\
  \ discoveries and insights that leverage Arizona State University research with\
  \ community engagement. Tempe is committed to using data to understand challenges,\
  \ inform strategies and evaluate outcomes and community impacts. This site is the\
  \ hub for data and insights to stop the spread of coronavirus/COVID-19. Please use\
  \ the translate button to view in Spanish or other languages. Por favor use el botón\
  \ de traducción para ver en español o otros idiomas. Stay informed and check-in\
  \ for updates and data that is informing city decisions. Follow to receive emails\

  \ Intro Tempe is in a unique position for an innovative response to the coronavirus/COVID-19\
  \ pandemic due to the Wastewater Data Analytics - Opioids program supported by the\
  \ Tempe City Council’s Innovation Fund in 2018 and the community trust cultivated\
  \ by our compassion, science and services approach in using public health data.\
  \ This strategic program advances the City Council Strategic Priorities and aligns\
  \ with the following strategic priorities and performance measures: Safe and Secure\
  \ Communities Feeling Safe in City Facilities (1.11) Feeling of Safety in Parks\
  \ (1.23) Feeling of Safety in Your Neighborhood (1.05) Strong Community Connections\
  \ Satisfaction with Availability of City Information (2.21) Quality of Life Community\
  \ Health and Well-Being (3.34) Mental Health &amp; Wellness (3.37) What's on This\

  \ Center for Environmental Health Engineering at Arizona State University. Source:\
  \ Arizona State University Explore How Tempe Does It In an innovative partnership\
  \ to prevent and reduce the spread of COVID-19, the City of Tempe is working with\
  \ scientists from Arizona State University's Biodesign Institute to study the city's\
  \ wastewater. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is the science of studying community\
  \ sewage for public health information. To better understand the science behind\
  \ the wastewater data, this dashboard displays emerging research about the “COVID-19\
  \ gene copies per liter” measured within collection areas throughout the city. \
  \ An example of “gene copies per liter” measurement is similar to measuring the\
  \ amount of salt in water.  The more salt in the water, the saltier the mixture.\
  \  Similarly, the more COVID-19 genes copies per liter, the stronger the virus’\
  \ signal. Wastewater Dashboard In utilizing public health data, Tempe integrates\
  \ data and sciences. The following dashboard displays the wastewater collection\
  \ areas. Note of Caution: We share this information with the public with the disclaimer\
  \ that only the future can tell how much “diagnostic value” we can and should attribute\
  \ to the numeric measurements we obtain from the sewer. However, what we measure,\
  \ the Covid-related RNA in wastewater, we know is real and we share that info with\
  \ our community. In the Tempe COVID -19 Wastewater Results Dashboard, please\nnote:\
  \ COVID-19 Cases per 100,000 by Zip Code These data show the number of people diagnosed\
  \ with COVID-19 per 100,000 people in each zip code for the reporting week. Case\
  \ rates are recommended for evaluating the spread of disease in the community because\
  \ case rates account for population size to more accurately reflect what is happening\
  \ in the community. Case rates are calculated using all confirmed and probable cases\
  \ (over the given week) per 100,000 people. A confirmed case is defined as a person\
  \ with a positive PCR test. A probable case is a person with a positive antigen\
  \ test or a symptomatic person with no test that is a close contact to a confirmed\
  \ COVID-19 case. Maricopa County COVID-19 transmission levels from low to high Courtesy\
  \ of Maricopa County (5/20/2021) maricopa.gov Notice:  Please see the Arizona Department\
  \ of Health Services website to see  Recent COVID-19 Cases by Zip Code and other\
  \ related data. The Arizona Department of Health Services (AZDHS) has paused updating\
  \ the open data for the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases for each zip code, which\
  \ supported the previous COVID-19 Confirmed Cases by Zip Code dashboard. The historic\
  \ data is accessible at https://data.tempe.gov/datasets/covid-19-cases-by-zip-code/explore.\
  \ We will maintain the process to download any AZDHS open data updates so that we\
  \ record any future updates that may be released.\n\n\nThe COVID-19 Cases Per 100,000\
  \ by Zip Code dashboard, which is currently shown, has replaced the previous dashboard.\
  \ It shows the COVID-19 case rate per 100,000 population by week for each zip code\
  \ and is supported by the weekly release of data from the Maricopa County Department\
  \ of Public Health (MCDPH). The Maricopa County Department of Public Health (MCDPH)\
  \ releases the PCR Test Percent Positivity and COVID-19 Case Rate per 100,000 population\
  \ by week for each zip code at ~8:45 AM weekly on Thursdays via the Maricopa County\
  \ GIS Open Data website. The COVID-19 Percent Positive by Zip Code and the COVID-19\
  \ Cases Per 100,000 by Zip Code dashboards show the history of the number of percent\
  \ positive tests and cases per 100,000 population weekly and the related community\
  \ transmission indicator status for each of the four zip codes in the City of Tempe.\
  \ The dashboard values are refreshed at 4:50 PM weekly on Thursdays. The most recent\
  \ date included on the dashboard is available by hovering over the last bar on the\
  \ right-hand side of each chart. Though the dashboards show data for Tempe's four\
  \ zip codes, data are available for all zip codes in the Maricopa County at https://data.tempe.gov/datasets/covid-19-case-indicators.\
  \ Please note that the times when the Maricopa County Department of Public Health\
  \ (MCDPH) releases weekly data for COVID-19 percent positive tests and cases per\
  \ 100,000 population may vary. If data are not released by the time of the scheduled\
  \ dashboard refresh, the values may appear on the dashboard with the next data release,\
  \ which may be one or more days after the last scheduled release. Learn About Fighting\
  \ COVID-19 with Public Health Data When it comes to fighting the spread of the coronavirus/COVID-19,\
  \ community leaders and first responders need relevant and up-to-date information\
  \ to make strategic and operational decisions about this public health crisis. Equity\
  \ and Inclusion In utilizing public health data, Tempe integrates data and sciences\
  \ with a commitment to equity and inclusion.   The following dashboard displays\
  \ demographics arranged by zip code areas. The zip code boundaries, demographics,\
  \ and the collection areas are not aligned.  Please note that results are from both\
  \ residents and nonresident contributors to the sewage system. Local Updates Tempe\
