  \ Information Systems or Geographic Information Science; it is a term that is used\
  \ to talk about mapping software and the process of mapping. GIS is founded in principles\
  \ of geography which studies the interrelationships of nature, science, people,\
  \ and the world. The City of Eugene uses GIS to help us understand our community,\
  \ to provide more efficient services in staffing and money, and to help us prepare\
  \ for the future. It is used in all departments in many forms. This can be mapping,\
  \ analysis, field data collection, in brochures, reports, behind the scenes for\
  \ data analysis, and more recently in web applications. Explore this webpage to\
  \ see all the different ways staff use mapping to serve our community. Watch the\
  \ video below to\nlearn more about how we are using GIS in our region. Interactive\
