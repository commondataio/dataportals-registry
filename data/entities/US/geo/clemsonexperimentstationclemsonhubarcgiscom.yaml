description: 'Experience, Research, Protect, Enjoy The work of researchers and Extension
  professionals at Clemson University is supported by a network of six Research and
  Education Centers (RECs) and the Clemson Experimental Forest (CEF), which in total
  encompass nearly 100,000 acres of farms, forests and other diverse natural landscapes.
  This is the platform for exploring these incredible resources.  You can download
  GIS data, see how others are using the RECs and CEF, and engage others to solve
  important problems. Come explore the Clemson University Experimental Farms and Forests!
  The six Research and Education Centers (RECs) are

  strategically located throughout the state according to the state''s distinct

  soil and climate regions. The Clemson Experimental Forest (CEF) consists of 17,500
  acres of mixed

  deciduous and coniferous forest adjacent to campus in Clemson, SC. Combined, these
  facilities provide outdoor laboratories for faculty and

  students seeking to advance agricultural and forestry sciences for the state,

  region and world. Project Portfolio Find Data CEF: A Story Map Forest Stands Operations
  Below are a series of projects that provide simple access to information about the
  forests and tools for managers and the public to collect data. Explore GIS datasets
  of our farms and forests and integrate them directly with your research and instructional
  purposes Go beyond data to find out more about the forest Smart management of forest

  are dedicated to education, research and demonstration in order to better understand
  and manage our natural resources for the benefit of society. These lands are used
  to meet current teaching, research, and public-oriented needs while serving as multipurpose
