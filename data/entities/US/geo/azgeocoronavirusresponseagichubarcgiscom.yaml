  \ Coronavirus Resources CDC logo CDC Resources Frequently Asked Questions See also\
  \ the CDC's general COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus FAQ. What is a novel coronavirus?\
  \ What is the source of the virus? Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?\
  \ What should healthcare professionals and health departments do? A novel coronavirus\
  \ is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing\
  \ coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that\
  \ commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.\
  \ A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19\
  \ diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently\
  \ than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis. Coronaviruses are a large family\
  \ of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline\
  \ coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals\
  \ have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected\
  \ to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome\
  \ (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of\
  \ coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people. More information\
  \ about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary:\
  \ Source and Spread of the Virus. It is not yet known whether weather and temperature\
  \ impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu,\
  \ spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible\
  \ to become sick with these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not\
  \ known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer. \
  \ There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features\
  \ associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing. See the FAQ for Healthcare\
  \ Professionals from the CDC for more information."
