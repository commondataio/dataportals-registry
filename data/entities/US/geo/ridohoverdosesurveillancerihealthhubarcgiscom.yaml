  Data Hub Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH)''s Drug Overdose Surveillance
  Data Hub provides several sources of non-fatal and fatal overdose data with a special
  focus on municipal, county, and statewide trends. This Data Hub is managed by the
  Substance Use Epidemiology Program. RIDOH’s Overdose Surveillance Data Hub features
  the following: Biosurveillance Biosurveillance Emergency Department Visits Emergency
  Department Visits Emergency Medical Service Runs Emergency Medical Service Runs
  Integrated Surveillance System Naloxone Distribution Overdose Fatalities Overdose
  Fatalities Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Prescription Drug Monitoring Program
  The Data Hub adheres to a Small Numbers Reporting Policy to ensure the confidentiality
  of individual identities. Data are suppressed when counts are fewer than five. The
  time period of analyses may vary depending on the data source, data availability,
  and counts. Some data sources are updated more frequently than others. The Data
  Hub works together with the state’s overdose information dashboard, PreventOverdoseRI.org
  (PORI), to create a holistic view of how opioids and drug overdose are impacting
  the state. Visit PORI to find a variety of historical overdose data trends, data
  stories, interactive visualizations, local resources, educational materials, and
  campaigns. PORI is an initiative of the Rhode Island Governor''s Overdose Prevention
  and Intervention Task Force, in collaboration with RIDOH, the Rhode Island Department
  of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals (BHDDH), and
  Brown University School of Public Health. Have an overdose-related data request? Visit
  RIDOH''s Drug Overdose Data Request webpage to learn more and submit a request.
  Rhode Island''s Municipal Drug Overdose Statistics The below map provides overdose
  data for Rhode Island''s 39 municipalities, including counts and rates of fatalities,
  emergency medical services (EMS) runs, naloxone distribution, and data reports.
  Overdose density maps or "heat maps" are included for municipalities where enough
  data are available. Note that timeframes vary by municipality based on counts. To
  learn more about how to interpret overdose density maps, refer to our "How to Read
  an Overdose Density Map" document. Click on any municipality to view local-level
  data. Map data are updated annually to allow for inclusion of communities with smaller
  counts. For up-to-date information by municipality, please view the Hub''s data
