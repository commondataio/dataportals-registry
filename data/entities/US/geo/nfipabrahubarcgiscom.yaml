description: 'The National Forest Integrity Project (NFIP) is a monitoring program
  created to track proposed and ongoing projects in the three National Forests that
  are located within the Central Appalachian Highlands (Monongahela in West Virginia
  and George Washington and Jefferson in Virginia). The NFIP will support informed
  review of proposed Forest Service land and water management projects, as well as
  other public and private-use projects in the National Forests. CURRENT FEATURED
