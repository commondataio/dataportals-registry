description: 'Ulster County was the first county to achieve Silver-level NYS Climate
  Smart Communities (CSC) certification in 2016, a notable accomplishment. The County
  completed its first five-year CSC recertification in 2021, and has established a
  goal of achieving Gold-level certification by 2025.The County continues to use the
  CSC Program as a framework in planning for and implementing its climate mitigation
  and adaptation initiatives, and many municipalities within the County are also capturing
  the benefits of participating in CSC. The Ulster County Department of the Environment
  maintains a webpage with CSC Program resources including up-to-date local municipal
  CSC participation statuses and relevant contact information.The resources provided
  on this website have been developed to support local municipalities in completing
  climate vulnerability assessments and identifying priority adaptation strategies
  in alignment with relevant CSC Program actions. These resources can be explored
  via the "Ulster County Interactive Map" and "Municipal Toolkit" tabs at the top
  of this page. Ulster County was the first county to achieve Silver-level NYS Climate
