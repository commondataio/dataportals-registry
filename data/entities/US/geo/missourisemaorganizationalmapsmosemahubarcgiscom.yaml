  \ This is the GeoHub for the Missouri State Emergency Management Agency. Access\
  \ to certain tools such as Search and Rescue and Damage Assessment Require a user\
  \ login. To Request access please contact your SEMA Regional Coordinator. If you\
  \ need additional information, please refer to State Emergency Management Agency's\
  \ website. For GIS related inquiries please send an email to Brandon Wolfe. Geographic\
  \ Information Systems (GIS) and the important spatial data they contain can be critical\
  \ tools in emergency management. During an emergency or disaster in Missouri, SEMA’s\
  \ GIS Program harnesses GIS technology to better assess and visualize damage statewide,\
  \ develop response priorities and logistics planning, and to track progress throughout\
  \ the response. SEMA GIS also provides important geospatial services that aid in\
  \ mitigation efforts. The Missouri Emergency Management Agency utilizes ESRI’s ArcGIS\
  \ Online to assist with response during disasters. See how the GIS team at Mo PHEP\
  \ and SEMA utilized ArcGIS Online products for the Covid 19 Pandemic response and\
  \ recover efforts: Missouri GIS COVID-19 Response. Office of Geospatial Information\
  \ The Office of Geospatial Information (OGI) was created in 2011 to \nprovide coordination,\
  \ guidance, and leadership, and to plan the \nimplementation of Missouri's statewide\
  \ geospatial information \ntechnology. The office identifies, coordinates, and guides\
  \ strategic \ninvestments in geospatial information technology, data, and service\
  \ \nsystems to ensure effective implementation and use of geospatial \ninformation\
  \ by state government, local government, and the public as an \nenterprise resource\
  \ to maximize benefits for Missourians. The mission of the OGI is to facilitate\
  \ the use of geospatial technologies and to coordinate the standardization of geographic\
  \ data, software, and methodologies within state government. GIS is essential in\
  \ all phases of emergency management, preparation, mitigation, response and recovery.\
  \ GIS allows information to be visualized spatially, shared among state agencies,\
  \ and updated real time empowering decision makers, saving lives and cutting costs.\
  \ GIS is an integral part of Missouri’s WebEOC. Tracy Schloss - Director of OGI\
