  Consortium is to efficiently share GIS datasets, maps, and apps with its members
  and the public. In doing so, the goal is to reduce costs and streamline the process
  of gathering authoritative GIS data. Through this collaboration, the Consortium
  hopes to increase communication between stakeholders and provide value to the Illinois
  Quad City GIS community. More Information The Illinois Quad Cities GIS Consortium
  was founded in early 2021, led by an initiative from Bi-State Regional Commission,
  the regional Metropolitan Planning Organization for the Quad Cities. Members include
  the City of Moline, the City of Rock Island, the City of East Moline, and the County
  of Rock Island. Thanks to feedback from its members, the Consortium now has a place
  to share authoritative data that is easily accessible to all. Data shared to the
  Consortium belongs to its original creator, but is accessible by all. The Consortium
  is not a form of government, but instead provides a platform for collaboration and
  sharing between local and regional governments. The Hub Site you see here provides
  a way to efficiently share GIS related items, which reduces staff time and storage
  costs, increases communication, and enhances the existing GIS community. Contact
