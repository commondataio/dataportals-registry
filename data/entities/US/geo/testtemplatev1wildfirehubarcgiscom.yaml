description: '(Community Wildfire Protection Plan) We''re developing long-term strategies
  to protect people and property from future wildfires. What is a CWPP? A Community
  Wildfire Protection Plan

  (CWPP) is a comprehensive framework developed by a variety of stakeholders

  including citizens and local, state and federal agencies. These protection

  plans are based on the needs of the residents in the community and address

  issues such as wildfire response, hazard mitigation, and community

  preparedness. A CWPP helps to

  prioritize areas for hazardous fuel reduction treatments and recommends the

  types and methods of treatment on lands that will

  protect communities and critical infrastructure. CWPP''s typically include Why is
  this important? Wildfires continue to grow in size, severity, and in their consequence.
  As a result, wildfires continue to cost lives, destroy property and infrastructure,
  and wreak havoc on landscapes. Limiting these impacts requires participation within
  a collaborative planning framework. Community Wildfire Protection Plans provide
  that framework for communities to address and reduce wildfire risk. In January 2022,
  the Forest Service launched a robust, 10-year strategy to address the wildfire crisis
  in the places where it poses the most immediate threats to communities. The strategy,
  called “Confronting the Wildfire Crisis: A Strategy for Protecting Communities and
  Improving Resilience in America’s Forests,” combines a historic investment of congressional
  funding with years of scientific research and planning into a national effort that
  will dramatically increase the scale and pace of forest health treatments over the
  next decade. Through the strategy, the agency will work with states, Tribes and
  other partners to addresses wildfire risks to critical infrastructure, protect communities,
  and make forests more resilient. Read the Wildfire Crisis Strategy document located
  to the right for more information. Get Involved The CWPP process is ongoing and
  you can see where we are in the timeline here. Draft CWPP Community Meetings Public
