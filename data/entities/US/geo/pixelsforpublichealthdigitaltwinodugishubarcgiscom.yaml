description: Digital Twin Technologies for Building Healthy, Resilient, and Equitable
  Communities By following this initiative you will get updates about new events,
  maps, and tools! A digital twin mirrors the reality of human and environmental geography.
  Healthy, resilient communities offer social, physical, and mental well-being to
  all residents and equity in services, access, and exposure to hazards. Our Sponsors
  and Partners A special thanks to the NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO)
  and the Equity and Environmental Justice (EEJ) program. In addition, many collaborating
  entities help us advance healthy community initiatives across Hampton Roads. Our
  Focus We are developing technologies to apply the latest advances in Earth Observations,
  IoT sensor networks, GIS, and environmental models and linking them in Digital Twin
  that mirrors the real world. The Digital Twin provides for collaborative analysis,
  testing what-if scenarios, and linkage of real-world data and simulation and modeling
  to enhance the capacity of end-users to make informed decisions. Earth Observations
  We apply massive volumes of EO satellite data from NASA, NOAA, EU Copernicus constellation
  and Uncrewed Autonomous Systems to map flooding and pre-cursor events, validate
  hydrodynamic models, and predict future sea level rise. Human Health and Resilient
  Communities We develop data and algorithms to promote quality of life with and equity
  in safe neighborhoods that are resilient to natural hazards. Geospatial Data and
  Tools Geospatial data and models tie together Earth observations, sensors, flood
  models and human health and enable analysis and visualization. Predicting Flooding
  and Sea Level Rise Hydrodynamic models are essential to risk assessment and disaster
  response. Sea level rise science is crucial to developing future scenarios for planning.
  We link these engineering and science disciplines to develop decision support systems.
  Transportation Resilience Geospatial data and models tie together Earth observations,
  sensors, flood models and human health and enable analysis and visualization. This
  hub effort includes data and analysis tools for Natural and Nature-Based Features
  (NNBFs) to promote sea-level adaptation and flood hazard mitigation. Technology
  Development and Applied Projects Projects in service to Hampton Roads from aircraft
  to people and everywhere in between. Frequently Asked Questions Common questions
  you may be asking about our Healthy Communities initiative. What is the water quality
  of the bays and rivers in our area? Where are vulnerable populations susceptible
  to flooding? Are public safety, food, and workplaces accessible? What impacts (and
  where) will sea level rise affect our area? What if sea level rise accelerates?
  How might this affect our quality of life? The water quality of the bays and rivers
  near Norfolk, Virginia, can vary depending on several factors. The Chesapeake Bay,
  located near Norfolk, has experienced water quality issues due to nutrient pollution,
  but efforts to reduce pollution have led to improvements. The James River, which
  flows through the area, has shown improvements in water quality in recent years,
  thanks to pollution reduction efforts. During severe floods in the Hampton Roads
  region, access to public safety, food, and workplaces can be limited or disrupted.
  In some areas, floodwaters can make roads impassable, making it difficult for emergency
  responders to reach those in need. Floods can also damage infrastructure, including
  electrical systems and water treatment plants, which can lead to disruptions in
  food and water supplies. Additionally, flooding can impact workplaces, causing business
  closures and disrupting employment. While there are measures in place to help mitigate
  the impacts of flooding, such as emergency response plans and evacuation procedures,
  severe flooding can still pose significant challenges to accessing essential services
  and resources. Sea level rise has had profound impacts on Hampton Roads, Virginia,
  a coastal region situated at the confluence of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic
  Ocean. The area, known for its military bases, historical sites, and vibrant communities,
  is facing significant challenges as the sea encroaches upon its shores. Rising water
  levels have led to increased coastal flooding, threatening infrastructure, homes,
  and businesses. The region is also experiencing saltwater intrusion, endangering
  freshwater supplies and delicate ecosystems. You may find areas likely to be impacted
  here. Have an Idea or Concern? A Digital Twin can host an infinite variety of data
  that replicate the real-world. Our data focus on coastal hazards and human health.
  Have we missed anything? Do you have an idea for a new dataset or a problem or concern
  that could be solved with new data? Please send us your ideas at tallen@odu.edu
