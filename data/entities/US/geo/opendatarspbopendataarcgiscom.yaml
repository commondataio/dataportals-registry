description: 'RSPB Open Data Portal Nature’s in crisis. Together we can save it. At
  the RSPB we carry out conservation work that you can see from space, built from
  the ground up. We protect habitats, save species, and help to end the nature and
  climate emergency. Our work is driven by science and powered by data. We can only
  save nature by working together, that''s why we’re committed to sharing our data
  openly wherever we can.  Our Open Data Portal gives you direct access to some of
  our most important conservation datasets.  It also provides you with tools to help
  understand and use these data, supporting you in taking your own actions for nature.
  Explore our datasets by category Boundaries Wild Bird Crime Habitats Assorted boundary
  datasets relating to various aspects of our work. Includes our nature reserve boundaries
  and UK Important Bird Areas. Data relating to crimes against wild birds.  Includes
  our raptor persecution datasets. Habitat, land use and land classification datasets.
  Energy Marine Bird Tracking Data relating to energy generation, sensitivity and
  opportunity mapping. Data covering the marine environment. Data derived from our
  bird tracking projects. Looking for species data? We make most of our open species
  datasets available through the NBN Atlas rather than our Open Data Portal. Explore
  our data on the NBN Atlas You can also access our marine datasets and seabird tracking
  data through the MEDIN portal and the the Birdlife Seabird tracking database. If
  you can''t find what you''re after you can ask us to run a custom data search for
