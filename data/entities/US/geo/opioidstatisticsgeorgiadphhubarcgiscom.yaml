description: "ONE PILL CAN KILL Beginning in the 1990s increased opioid\nprescribing\
  \ led to an epidemic of opioid misuse, opioid-use disorder (OUD) and\nconsequent\
  \ overdoses. Illicit opioids, such as heroin, led to further increases\nbeginning\
  \ in 2010. Beginning in 2013, synthetic opioids such fentanyl drove the\nsharp increase\
  \ in opioid-involved overdose deaths. Since 2022, overdose deaths\nhave reached\
  \ record highs fueled by illicitly manufactured fentanyl and\npolysubstance use.\
  \ The market for illicitly manufactured fentanyl continues to\nchange and it is\
  \ found in combination with heroin, counterfeit pills, and\nstimulants such as cocaine\
  \ and amphetamines. Fentanyl remains the deadliest drug threat facing the country.\
  \ According to the DEA, most fake prescription pills now contain a potentially lethal\
  \ dose of fentanyl. Any drug that is not prescribed by a licensed medical professional\
  \ and dispensed by a legitimate pharmacy can contain deadly amounts of fentanyl.\
  \ Without laboratory testing there is no way to know what it contains. ONE PILL\
  \ CAN KILL 2022 Opioid Deaths by Zip Code Three Waves of Opioid Overdose Deaths\
  \ in Georgia Drug Overdose Deaths From\n2019 to 2021 fentanyl-involved overdose\
  \ deaths increased by 232% \namong adults and 800% among adolescents (persons aged\
  \ 10-19 years). The\nproportion of overdose deaths involving fentanyl increased\
  \ from 21% to 78%. From 2019 to 2021, drug overdose deaths increased 123% among\
  \ Hispanic persons compared to 60% among non-Hispanic persons.\n\n From 2019 to\
  \ 2021, drug overdose deaths increased 65% among Blacks compared to 60% among Whites.\n\
  \n From 2019 to 2021, drug overdose deaths increased 110% among persons aged 15-24\
  \ years, 102% among persons aged 25-34 years, and 86% among persons aged 35-44 years.\n\
  \ \n Naloxone can reverse an overdose and save a\nlife if administered shortly after\
  \ an overdose. In 2021, 53% of overdose death\nhad a bystander present. Carrying\
  \ naloxone can save a life, for more\ninformation visit Stop Opioid Addiction.\n\

  \ for intervention visit CDC Drug Overdose Dashboard.The maps and charts below show\
  \ the counts and rates (both crude and age adjusted) of drug\noverdose deaths (mortality)\
  \ by year in Georgia. Select county, measure type (rate or count), and year to filter\n\
  the data. The default view displays statewide data, age-adjusted rate, and most\n\
