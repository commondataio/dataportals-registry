  VGIN News and Updates Updated August 10, 2023 Upcoming GIS Events Welcome to VGIN's
  new website VGIN's new website has been in planning and development and released
  in late March 2022.  Functions of the Virginia GIS Clearinghouse have been expanded,
  and additional content has been updated. The updated Virginia GIS Clearinghouse
  supports Virginia stakeholders using ESRI's Open Data to make their GIS data, applications,
  and resources available for search, discovery, and distribution.  Site administrators
  can join the appropriate AGOL groups for the Virginia GIS Clearinghouse with these
  instructions, or reach out to VGIN staff for support. Be sure to bookmark vgin.vdem.virginia.gov
  to stay up to date with VGIN activities in the future. VGIN Production Highlights
  About VGIN The Virginia Geographic Information Network (VGIN) was established in
  Code of Virginia in 1997 (§44-146.18:6) with the mission to support innovative uses
  of geospatial data and technologies.  VGIN's stakeholders span all levels of the
  public sector (federal, commonwealth, regional, and local government), the private
  sector community, academia, and citizens. The Virginia Department of Emergency Management
  is a unit under the Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security.  VDEM's mission
  covers prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery against acts of
  terrorism and natural or manmade disasters.  VDEM is led by State Emergency Management
  Coordinator Shawn Talmadge, and is headquartered in Richmond.  VDEM operates seven
  regional offices across the commonwealth to support local and regional planning,
  response and recovery operations. Additional Information For additional information,
  please reach out to VGIN staff or the VBMP Inbox.
