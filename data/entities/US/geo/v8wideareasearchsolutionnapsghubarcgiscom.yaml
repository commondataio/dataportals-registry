description: 'This hub site can be used to deploy v8 of the SAR survey, QuickCapture
  project, web applications, and dashboards into your ArcGIS Online Organization.
  Step 1 Determine if you really want to deploy these tools for your team/organization.
  There are instances where a jurisdiction would want to set up and manage these tools
  for their team; however during large-scale disasters, having multiple instances
  of the tools can lead to silos and make coordination amongst multiple jurisdictions
  difficult. We encourage you to consider joining the National Search and Rescue Geospatial
  Coordination (NSARGC) Group where your team could be granted access to a single
  system being utilized by all 28 FEMA Teams as well as multiple states and local
  entities. This provides a true common operational platform for response. If you
  would like to learn more about the NSARGC Group and how you may be able to join,
  please contact Jared Doke (jdoke@publicsafetygis.org) and Paul Doherty (paul.doherty@fema.dhs.gov)
  Once the template and tools are deployed into your organization, you own them and
  any changes or updates will need to be configured by you. Please see step 3 for
  a list of initial configuration changes that will have to be made after deployment
  and step 4 for a running list of configuration changes that are implemented to the
  NSARGC instance of the tools based on feedback from exercises and real-world incidents.
  Step 2 Watch the video below and follow along with the instructions to deploy the
  solution in your organization using ArcGIS Hub. Using this site as a template does
  not require ArcGIS hub Premium. Step 3 Download the PowerPoint document below and
  work through it using the newly deployed items. This PowerPoint is intended to be
  used as a checklist to verify and configure items created during the deployment
  of the v8 Wide Area Search Solution for Urban Search and Rescue. On the first slide,
  you should replace ITEM ID for each item listed with the last 6 digits of the actual
  item ID created during the deployment of the solution. It is also recommended to
  hyperlink the last 6 digits you enter to the item detail page for that item. This
  will give you a quick reference guide for which layers and maps are used in each
  application. The remaining slides walk you through re-configuring the item details
  page and making minor tweaks for each item so that it will work properly in your
  organization. Step 4 We are continually making enhancements to the NSARGC instance
  of the wide area search tools. Since the solution was initially released to the
  public on September 17, 2021 the following changes have been made:'
