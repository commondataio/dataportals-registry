description: SAFMC South Atlantic Fishery Management Council The SAFMC Atlas is a
  new platform for searching and visualizing GIS data relevant to the Council's mission. 
  You can view story maps, dashboards, web maps and applications. Come explore the
  marine and fishery resources of the South Atlantic Bight. Explore SAFMC Story Maps
  Story maps provide an interactive approach to learning more about SAFMC projects
  and issues.  Take a tour of managed areas, the SEAMAP-SA program, and the new approach
  to protect spawning areas for the snapper grouper complex. Explore SAFMC Dashboards
  A dashboard is a view of geographic information and data that allows you to  make
  decisions, inform others, and see trends. Dashboards are designed to display multiple
  visualizations that work together on a single screen. Explore SAFMC data Essential

  based on new management measures and as fisheries open and close with the season
  once annual catch limits have been reached. As of January 1, 2018, the Council transitioned
  to using the Fish Rules mobile app to keep you updated on federal fishing regulations
  in the South Atlantic. Learn more about the Fish Rules App here.
