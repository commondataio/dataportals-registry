  \ Vision Explore and engage with key issues affecting the City in our new Community\
  \ \nAdvisory Group program - together we can make Escondido stand out strong. City\
  \ Council's vision is for a highly engaged community representing diverse opinions,\
  \ backgrounds, and demographics to come together in a grassroots effort to discuss\
  \ issues affecting Escondido and offer recommendations that, in partnership with\
  \ the City and with support from the community, can address our collective challenges.\
  \ Our Focus Areas Youth Sports Providing our youth with active opportunities is\
  \ integral to building healthy communities. Lakes and Parks Amenities From urban\
  \ parks to rural spaces, our City has a lot to offer with outdoor activities. We'll\
  \ look at opportunities to expand and augment these facilities with amenities and\
  \ improvements to provide safe, active spaces for our entire community. New Aquatic\
