  Redistricting Commission Hub A new Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission
  (IRC) was appointed in January 2021 to adopt new congressional and legislative districts
  for Arizona. This website is being used to specifically display geographic and other
  related information to inform the public about IRC''s work. Visit IRC Homepage &gt;&gt;&gt;

  aimed to help the public better understand the geography of Arizona and the demographics
  of the people that live across the state. Start Exploring &gt;&gt;&gt; Grid Map
  The U.S. Constitution requires that each Congressional district within a state must
  have as identical a number of people as possible and each Legislative district within
  a state must have close to the same number of people. The grid map uses the most
  recent Census data and creates nine (9) balanced Congressional Districts and thirty
  (30) balanced Legislative Districts across the state "in a grid-like manner" as
  required by the state constitution. This grid is simply meant to serve as a starting
  point for the mapping process. The Grid Maps were adopted by the Commission on September
  14, 2021 and appear at the link below. Watch the Grid Map presentation and the unanimous
  approval by the Commission. Learn more &gt;&gt;&gt; Redistricting System What is
  the Redistricting System?Â The Redistricting System is a free tool available to anyone
  interested in proposing changes to the Arizona legislative and congressional maps.
  The System provides users comprehensive data, features and functionality for plan
  management, visualization, editing, and community collaboration using the latest
  available census and state data to draw maps and submit them to the Commission.

  Submitted Plan Tracker Read Only Plan Tracker Total Plans Published Draft Maps Following
  a series of hearings for Arizona residents to submit proposed changes to the Grid
  Maps to improve the maps'' compliance with the requirements of Proposition 106,
  the Commission will meet to discuss and adopt an official Draft Legislative Map
  and an official Draft Congressional Map. Draft Map decision meetings occurred from
  October 4, 2021 through October 28, 2021. Both maps were adopted on October 28,
  2021 followed by a minimum of 30 days for the public and the legislature to submit
  comments and any desired revisions for Commission consideration for the next round
  of modifications. Learn more &gt;&gt;&gt; Final Draft Maps Final decision meetings
  will occur from December 6, 2021 through December 22, 2021. Input provided by the
  public and the legislature will be considered and the Approved Drafts Maps will
  undergo further changes towards being finalized. Learn more &gt;&gt;&gt; Officially
  Adopted Maps Once the Commission officially adopts the final draft maps, county
  election officials will have a period of time to request minor changes to assist
  with election administration (precinct locations, polling location, split addresses).
  Once these minor changes have been completed for both maps, all official maps along
  with supporting documentation will be placed here. Learn more &gt;&gt;&gt;'
