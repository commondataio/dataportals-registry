description: 'Sonoma County CWPP Hub Site Resources to help build a fire resilient
  Sonoma County Welcome to the Sonoma County Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP)
  Hub Site! This website is being used to inform and collect feedback on Permit Sonoma’s
  effort to update their Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP). Help us by perusing
  this site and providing feedback on a Community Base Map. Scroll down for more information
  or to use our tools. About the Hub Site About the Project Entry Portal and the CWPP
  Project List To make our homes, communities, and ecosystems more resilient to wildfire,
  projects can be developed by agencies and/or organizations such as fire safe councils,
  COPE or CERT groups, and neighborhood associations.  Risk reduction projects might
  include a wide variety of activities, such as helping to create defensible space
  or harden homes, roadside vegetation management, developing and implementing shaded
  fuel breaks, community organizing, education, and planning.The CWPP Project List
  provides a central location to list wildfire risk reduction projects. The CWPP Project
  Entry Portal is where projects can be entered to be screened for inclusion on the
  Project List. Having a project listed in a CWPP is a requirement for many grant
  programs, so it is important to get your project on the list if you are seeking
  funding. Additionally, projects entered in the portal will create a county-wide
  view of where projects have been developed, and where projects are needed so that
  overall trends and needs can be identified. Having the list in place will help to
  prioritize funding across the county. The Hub Site is a work in progress, the “living
  document” of the CWPP. We expect to change and evolve over time. Your feedback is
  very important to us. If you have questions or suggestions, please email us at PermitSonomaWildfirePlan@sonoma-county.org.
  The Hub Site is the active arm of the CWPP.Here you can explore: Project Entry Portal
