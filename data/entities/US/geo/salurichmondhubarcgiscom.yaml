  Team (ABSAT) Barton Heights Cemeteries The Mobile Map and Web Explorer tools linked
  above offer access to a digital map detailing all 330+ of the visible grave markers
  found in the six historic conjoined cemeteries that are now known as the Barton
  Heights Cemeteries in Richmond, Virginia. From 2018-2023, members of the  East End
  Cemetery Collaboratory , students, volunteers, and most importantly, descendants
  of those buried at the cemeteries have worked together to supply the information
  and images found in this map. The map is intended to be used as a resource for descendants
  and visitors to navigate the rich history of the cemeteries and learn about the
  lives of those buried there. Read the full news report here! Need help? Request
  GIS assistance through this survey Survey Link This Qualtrics Survey is used to
  collect GIS Instruction requests. It ask questions about your class, skill level
  and lab objectives. Managed by the Spatial Analysis Lab, INTC300 Dr. David Salisbury
  and Dr. Steph Spera in the SAL with geography students Elizabeth Halasz (’22) and
  Peter Braun (’21). About the SAL The University of Richmond’s Spatial Analysis Lab
  is the premier on-campus location for anything related to GIS (Geographic Information
  Systems). Located in room 300 of the International Center, alongside the Department
  of Geography, Environment and Sustainability, our hybrid classroom / computer lab
  offers ESRI ArcGIS mapping software, as well as various other remote sensing, statistical,
  and design software. The SAL hosts lab classes, research meetings, workshops and
  special guest speakers. Check the Google Calendar for booking times. The SAL is
  maintained by a full- time faculty director, Dr. Kyle Redican, and an Operations
  Manager, Beth Zizzamia. Dr. Redican oversees the core tasks of SAL in supporting
  research and teaching, and facilitates the use of SAL’s space, software, hardware,
  and materials. Mrs. Zizzamia maintains the physical and virtual infrastructure,
  while providing technical training and support to the UR community. The SAL also
  employs student interns who have taken the GIS classes offered at the University
  of Richmond. SAL Interns get the opportunity to be involved in meaningful research
  and often get the chance to present their work at Geography conferences further
  building their resumes for real world preparedness. ArcGIS Online at URichmond The
  University of Richmond maintains it's own ArcGIS Online (AGOL) organization. AGOL
  is a cloud-based mapping and analysis solution. The Spatial Analysis Lab manages
  the account and the members, ensuring that students and faculty have access to the
  tools they need. Hundreds of members across the university utilize the power of
  spatial science and geovisualization tools each semester to produce impressive maps
  and web products. Click here for detailed instructions on how to log in for the
  first time. Anyone affiliated with the University of Richmond with an active netid
  can sign in. Use the button below to be redirected to the URichmond AGOL organization

  James River Rock Pools project site. Spatial Research Projects Independent and collaborative
  student research is one of the cornerstones of the Spatial Analysis Lab’s approach
  to teaching GIS and spatial analysis. Our students and alumni have had great success
  presenting their research at conferences all over the US and even internationally.
  Student Presentations GIS Classes A variety of GIS classes are taught at the University
  of Richmond including an Introductory class, Advanced Spatial Analysis and several
  special topics like geovisualization and public health. For more details on the
