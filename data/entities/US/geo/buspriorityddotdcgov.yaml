description: DDOT Bus Priority Projects We are always looking for feedback on active
  or completed projects. Click here to access the Bus Priority Survey. Choose 'Specific
  Project Feedback' to see a list of projects. Mayor Muriel Bowser established the
  Bus Priority Program to improve bus speeds and reliability for riders across the
  District. The bus priority network provides vital connections to jobs, schools,
  healthcare, and other destinations. While most buses in the District are operated
  by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), the District Department
  of Transportation (DDOT) constructs and maintains infrastructure on the street,
  such as bus lanes, bus stops, and traffic signals. By improving bus service, DDOT
  is improving mobility and access to opportunities for District residents, workers,
  and visitors. Bus Priority Network Map Click on a street to learn more about a project
  Active Projects Projects in Planning In the planning phase, DDOT assesses existing
  conditions, gathers stakeholder input, and develops concepts that meet project goals.
  Projects in Design In the design phase, DDOT develops detailed plans to construct
  the recommended improvements and solicits feedback to refine the design. Projects
  Under Construction In the construction phase, DDOT builds the project. View project
  pages for specific updates on construction timelines. Give Feedback List of Upcoming
