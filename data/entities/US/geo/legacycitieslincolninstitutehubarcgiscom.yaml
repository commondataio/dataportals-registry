description: Legacy Cities Geospatial Data Hub (draft) Legacy cities throughout the
  United States face many similar challenges as they adapt to twenty-first-century
  economic realities. Use this website to find, visualize, and access geospatial data
  and applications used in comparable cities to your own. Indicators The Legacy Cities
  Initiative is a national network of community and government leaders that creates
  shared prosperity and brings attention to the common needs and collective importance
  of older industrial centers in the United States. Learn more about these cities
