description: Tackle the Opioid Epidemic Reducing prescription drug abuse in our community
  Opioids were once reserved for the most serious of medical conditions to help alleviate
  the pain. But in the last 15 years, the amount of prescription opioids sold in the
  U.S. has quadrupled, whilst no overall change in the amount of pain had been reported.
  Given that opioids are highly addictive, it is easy to develop dependance on them
  very quickly. On average, 91 Americans die everyday from opioid overdoses (CDC.)
  Pharmacies in the U.S. dispense enough painkillers to supply **every citizen with
  one pill, every four hours, around the clock for an entire month.** New Map Timeline
