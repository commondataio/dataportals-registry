description: 'ESF #3 Mission Models Through the use of geospatial tools and spatial
  analysis, the USACE models the possible debris volumes, temporary roofing estimates,
  temporary housing needs, critical infrastructure impacts, and number of people and
  households likely within hurricane force winds.  Model estimates are developed and
  posted to this website.  These model results provide emergency managers and responders
  with a first look at the potential severity of a storm of interest and are intended
  to set the “scale and scope” of the storm event. Tropical Hazards Overview (View
