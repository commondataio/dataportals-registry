description: Sambus Open Data Hub Discover free public data, tools, and resources
  from Sambus Geospatial Limited and other contributors through the Sambus Open Data
  Hub Initiative. On this site, Sambus Geospatial Limited shares hundreds of datasets
  under the Sambus Opendata Initiative. We realize that data’s greatest value comes
  from having it freely shared among students, researchers, agencies, local, state,
  and federal governments, and the public to the extent possible while considering
  safety, privacy, and security. Sambus invites you to browse the data, download it
  as a file, analyze it with your tools, or build apps using ArcGIS APIs. Explore
  data with WebMaps A web map is an interactive display of geographic information
  that tell stories and answer questions. For example, you may find a map that addresses
  the question, How many people in Abuja live within a reasonable walk or drive to
  a supermarket? A map with the relevant data layers would assist in answering this
  question. Browse Data by Category There's a lot to see here, so feel free to peruse
  our data library from the following categories Transportation Finance and Economics
