  County Trail In 2015, Camden County adopted a Bicycling &amp; Multi-Use Trails Plan,
  which depicts nearly 500 miles of multi-use trails and on-street bicycling facilities
  in every borough and township in the county.  In order to jump start the implementation
  of this ambitious plan, county officials have tentatively established a “Cross County
  Trail”, which will start in the city of Camden on the Delaware River waterfront,
  and run approximately 32 miles to the Atlantic County line.  The Cross County Trail
  would act as a “spine” to which future trails and bike lanes can connect to. In
  order to help refine the proposed trail alignment, we want to hear from you. What
  is important as we develop this major trail route? Where do you want it to go? How
  should we use our resources? More Information: Cross County Trail Plan Need More
