description: 'Ready to use maps, layers, and applications to better understand our
  oceans Welcome to the GIS for Ocean webpage.  This hub serves as a resource to help
  collate the wealth of ready to use ocean related GIS resources available to the
  community.  Whether you are in search of content to add to your maps, blogs from
  the community about practical uses of ocean data, or applications that provide data-driven
  answers, you are in the right place! ARGO Locations (Latest Locations) Deployment_Locations

  Access Ocean Data A curated collection of ready to use maps and layers that provide
  context for your ocean related projects. Ocean Projects GIS provides many unique
  ways to visualize and interact with your data to provide more insight. From maps
  to charts and graphs, this gallery demonstrates some of different projects for ocean
  analysis and marine spatial planning. Anti-Shipping Activity Messages Anti-shipping

  marine and coastal Quickly visualize and graph change in the global ocean using
  data from NOAA''s World Ocean Atlas (WOA) for six oceanographic variables: temperature,
  salinity, dissolved oxygen, silicate, nitrate, and phosphate.  Using the variables,
  the locations have been statistically clustered into 36 different unique water masses
  that are each named using the CMECS standard.  Each 1/4 degree location also contains
  seafloor characteristics and the app provides the ability to compare change to the
  previous WOA release. Applications Web applications that provide access to exploring
  ocean datasets over time. Blogs Blue economy, marine spatial planning, citizen science
  or other maritime related focused blogs from the community. StoryMaps Stories from
  the ocean that help us better understand and connect with different topics using
  geographic content. Learn Guided lessons using ocean related content that can help
  you stay fresh. The GIS for Oceans Hub is maintained by Esri staff in collaboration
  with our partners in ocean science. This site is built for the Oceans Community.
