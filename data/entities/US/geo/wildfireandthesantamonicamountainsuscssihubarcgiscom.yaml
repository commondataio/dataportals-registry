description: Wildfire and the Santa Monica Mountains Streamlining access to relevant
  data for use in analysis, visualization, and decision-making. This hub was created
  by Geodesign students at the University of Southern California as a deliverable
  for the semester-long project completed to satisfy the requirements of SSCI 412.
  The target audience of the hub is our client, the Resource Conservation District
  of the Santa Monica Mountains (RCDSMM) and we hope this resource can be of value
  in future fire management efforts.
