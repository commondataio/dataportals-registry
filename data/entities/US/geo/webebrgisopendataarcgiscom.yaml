  \ can our GIS do for you? Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are platforms for\
  \ storing location-based data which can be used for mapping, analysis, operations,\
  \ decision-making, and community engagement. The City of Baton Rouge and Parish\
  \ of East Baton Rouge uses its GIS to manage addresses, administrative boundaries,\
  \ property, land use, roads, infrastructure, and many other assets.The City-Parish's\

  \ open data, discovering maps and apps, and engaging your local government to solve\
  \ important community issues. Through this platform, the City-Parish is able to\
  \ share a vast amount of geospatial data with everyone. Each map layer includes\
  \ ISO standard metadata describing the data and its currency, accuracy and collection\
