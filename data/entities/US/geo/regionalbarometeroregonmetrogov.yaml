description: "The Regional Barometer provides a snapshot of information about racial\
  \ equity, communities, climate, the natural environment, the economy and transportation\
  \ from early 2020. Users can view easy-to-understand facts and figures with some\
  \ key context and accompanying narratives; access related Metro plans, strategies,\
  \ research and reports; and download data for additional analysis. Search for data,\
  \ maps, and applications Metro is committed to providing reliable and trustworthy\
  \ data. But data has limitations. It is a best practice to consider data in a larger\
  \ context, which is why the Regional Barometer offers relevant reports and other\
  \ links that provide more information related to the facts and figures on this site.\
  \ Additionally, quantitative data speaks to observable conditions without a historic\
  \ context. Data categorized by race or ethnicity, interpreted in isolation, could\
  \ erase the cause and impacts of multigenerational institutional racism and the\
  \ biases held by those with political and economic power. Racial categories also\
  \ continue to follow historically assigned lines based on broad, often biased, categories\
  \ that can obscure the lived experience of different communities. Information in\
  \ the Regional Barometer comes from Metro and state, federal and other public agencies\
  \ that track food,  health, education and other topics. By offering information\
  \ on a wide variety of topics the Regional Barometer provides a picture broader\
  \ than Metro’s portfolio to better inform everyone working to improve greater Portland.\
  \ Data is the beginning of a policy conversation. It can shine a light on issues\
  \ and inequities. But solutions must consider past and present policies and governmental\
  \ practices – including how and whom those benefited and excluded; economic and\
  \ social pressures and impacts; and the broader values, visions and goals of all\
  \ of the people affected. We welcome your feedback, questions, and inquiries at\
  \ \n    regionalbarometer@oregonmetro.gov\n    regionalbarometer@oregonmetro.gov"
