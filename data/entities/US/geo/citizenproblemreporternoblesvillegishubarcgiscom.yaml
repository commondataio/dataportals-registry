  Does the Call Center handle emergency services? Yes, you can search for your problem
  report and check the status of your report at any time. No, you can remain anonymous
  when you submit a problem report. However, responsible agencies may want to follow
  up so providing contact information often ensures problems can be resolved more
  quickly. If you share your email address with us, we’ll send you a satisfaction
  survey after the work has been completed. No, the Call Center only handles non-emergency
  problem reports.  Call 911 in the case of an emergency (burning house, accident,
  robbery, crime in progress, etc.)
