  publicly released data and services can be discovered, viewed, and downloaded in
  a variety of formats. Simply use the search bar at the top of the page to find data
  relating to your topics of interest. When you have located any desired data, you
  can investigate its contents further and access download options. Data is offered
  for download in several ways. Data can be downloaded as Shapefiles or KML for GIS
  applications, and CSV for tables and spreadsheets. Additionally, by using the API
  link, data from this site can be embedded in other applications with the feature
  service link or GeoJson. NGA joined the National Science Foundation (NSF) to partner
  with the University of Minnesota and other members of the academic research community,
  private sector and international partners. Together, these partners are working
  to create the first ever publically available, high resolution, satellite-based
  elevation map of Alaska by mid-2016 and the entire Arctic by mid-2017. These initiatives
  by NGA support the US Chair of the Arctic Council and the Presidentâ€™s Executive
  Order on Enhancing Coordination of National Efforts in the Arctic. Explore Data
