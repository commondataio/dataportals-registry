description: Municipal Roads General Permit Quantifying roadway erosion issues through
  data driven analysis Stormwater runoff increases erosion, which can negatively impact
  water quality in Vermont. Through the results of the Clean Water Act, a new permit
  issued by VT ANR called the Municipal Roads General Permit (MRGP) will be required
  for all towns in Vermont.  This permit sets roadway erosion standards, and by bringing
  all municipal roads up to these standards, we can achieve significant reductions
  in stormwater-related erosion from municipal roads, both paved and unpaved. The
  Data Road Erosion Inventory click me! Evaluation of Results Upon completion of the
  Road Erosion Inventory (REI), the CCRPC evaluated, or 'scored' all segments.  This
  process looks at all of the discrete variables observed during the field inspection
  to determine whether a given road segment Fully Meets, Partially Meets, or Does
  Not Meet MRGP road erosion standards. The initial results are below. A Deeper Dive
  Rather than providing simplified maps and access to the data itself, CCPRC staff
  have created an interactive dashboard to explore the data on a more detailed level. 
  On the right is a dashboard for all of Chittenden County.  Below are dashboards
  built for individual municipalities. Planning and Implementation Although the Municipal
  Roads General Permit is a 20 year permit, there are intermediate goals towns will
  need to meet.  In roughly five year intervals, municipalities will need to bring
  a certain percentage of their segments up to standard.  Through the inventory, scoring,
  and analysis of Chittenden County's REI data, the CCRPC have helped towns in their
  planning efforts to prioritize project locations that have a greater impact on water
  quality.  Consultants on retainer are providing scoping level solutions for these
  identified areas and are positioning towns for competitive grant programs with quality
  reports. The CCRPC is trying to help Chittenden County municipalities get ahead
  of the game through assistance with various state and federal funding mechanisms.  This
  occurs not only in the planning/scoping of projects as shown on the right, but in
  acquiring grants for physical construction. Better Data, Better Decisions An example
  of South Burlington's Stormwater infrastructure (green) and connected segments (red/pink)
  Across Chittenden County, 3,375 curbed segments "drain" to 758 hydrologically connected
  outfalls.  Only 501 of these outfalls have been inventoried as there are questions
  as to whether they serve municipal storm systems (instead of private or state roads).  This
  information needs a more robust GIS analysis which will rely on the comprehensiveness
  and accuracy of a given municipalities' stormwater data. Work in Progress CCRPC
  will continue to use this platform to inform public officials for better decision
  making.  In the future we hope to expand on exploring this data at a more town specific
  level.  please check back for future updates! Contact Information cdubin@ccrpcvt.org
