description: Wilson County 2020 Census Welcome to the Wilson County Open Data Portal
  for the 2020 United States Census The 2020 census is a critical opportunity for
  each resident of Wilson County to be countedÂ  as part of the decennial census, as
  mandated by the United States Constitution. The decennial census provides accurate
  population estimates that impact the drawing of congressional districts as well
  as many vital programs such as education, housing, transportation, and social services.
  These programs benefit all residents and businesses in our community, and it is
  very important that Wilson County residents take this opportunity to insure that
  our community counts. No matter of age, residence status, or location, everyone
  must be counted. Wilson County is proud to provide county stakeholders with high-quality
  public information and source data in order to facilitate improved community engagement
  and informed decision-making. Our open data site offers the ability to Search, Filter,
  Download and use API Access to our data. Users can find a variety of data and information
  on this portal for use in Spreadsheets, Shapefiles, and Web Applications. Title
  13 of the U.S. Code requires that any information collected through the census be
  kept confidential. This means that individual personal information acquired by the
  US Census Bureau can not be shared with any law enforcement or other government
  agency for 72 years. Violating this law is a crime with severe penalties including
  a fine of up to $250,000 or imprisonment of up to 5 years, or both. April 1, 2020
  begins the kickoff for the 2020 decennial census. State population totals must be
  submitted to the President of the United States by December 31, 2020. Help us to
  insure that Wilson County is properly counted for the future. Search for Data 2020
