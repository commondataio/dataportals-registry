description: Redistricting Data Hub Welcome to the Oregon Redistricting Data Hub.
  This site provides free, public access to geographic data and maps that relate to
  the State of Oregon's redistricting process. What is redistricting? Redistricting
  is the process of redrawing legislative and congressional district lines following
  the U.S. Census that takes place every 10 years. The lines are redrawn so that districts
  are of roughly equal population as required by the Oregon Constitution and the U.S.
  Constitution. The Oregon Legislature is responsible for redistricting the stateâ€™s
  60 House and 30 Senate districts, as well as the U.S. Congressional districts. Redistricting
  plans, like other legislation, are defined in bills passed by the legislature. As
  with all legislative enactments, redistricting plans are subject to the veto authority
  of the Governor. 2021 Adopted Redistricting Plans On September 27, 2021, the Legislative
  Assembly completed the adoption of new congressional and legislative redistricting
  plans for Oregon with the passage of Senate Bill 881 and Senate Bill 882. These
  plans were signed into law by Governor Brown and subsequently upheld by the courts.
  Elections using these new plans will take place in 2022 with those elected taking
  their seats in January of 2023. Use the tools below to find which new districts
  your address falls into or explore the new districts across the state. 2021 Data
  and Maps Geospatial data related to the redistricting process has been made available
  in a variety of formats. Enter a search term if you're looking for something specific.
  To create maps of your own, explore the feature services and shapefile downloads.
  If you'd like to print a map of your new district, take a look at some of our pre-made
  PDF maps. Additional Resources The Oregon Legislature website has a number of resources
  related to the redistricting process. Select the year you'd like additional information
  about.
