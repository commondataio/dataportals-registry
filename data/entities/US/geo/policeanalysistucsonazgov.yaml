description: 'As part of our commitment to transparency and accountability, the Tucson
  Police Department is empowering community members to explore and download policing
  data. Topics Modern policing is informed by data. Data provides information on what''s
  working well, and what needs improvement.TPD is working to make more of its internal
  data available to the rest of the community, to inform discussions around law enforcement
  in Tucson. NOTE: The Tucson Police Department is currently changing its data display
  software. Until this transition is complete, police use of force data is not linked
  to this external website. That data link has been temporarily disabled. Use of Force
  Just one-tenth of one percent of all TPD officer-involved events use any physical
  force. Police Activity Responsive, proactive policing: 911 calls, investigations,
  traffic stops, and other police activity. Reported Crimes Reported criminal activity
  by category, location, date, and time. Arrests The Tucson Police Department solved
  85% of homicides in 2019—well above the national average. Traffic Collisions Speed
  and intoxication are contributing factors in many Tucson traffic fatalities. Traffic
  Enforcement Education, enforcement, and engineering can reduce collisions—and fatalities.
  What''s in this data? Data is drawn from preliminary reports, which may vary from
