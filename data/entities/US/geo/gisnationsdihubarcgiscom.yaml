description: GIS for a Nation (Demo) This website provides an example of a National
  Geospatial Infrastructure platform. Government agencies can federate trusted, public
  geospatial data, services, and applications for the public and organize collaboration
  around targeted initiatives. This targeted site focuses on the portfolio of GIS
  data assets of national priority, also known as the National Geospatial Data Assets
  (NGDA), provided as actionable open data and services. NSDIs can quickly create
  a web of community-based, targeted sites that is easy to discover, while distributing
  ownership to different community teams. Featured National Geospatial Data Assets

  → OMB Circular A16 Revised, Appendix E in 2010 defined the themes by which authoritative
  government data would be managed by the Federal Geospatial Data Committee. Federal
  Agency Geospatial ResourcesMore → Many federal agencies provide their own authoritative
  data resource sites to disseminate open and FAIR data services. Communities of InterestMore
  → Communities of interest form around specific priority initiatives and time-sensitive
  community events. Our goal is to provide a collaboration space around authoritative
  data and decision support tools for those focal points. Map Collections to Inform
  COVID Policy Response Public Policy map collections use national geospatial data
  assets use cartographic best practices to help decision makers understand data at
  the time of decision.  This example below of 11 key maps highlighting insights from
  datasets from the U.S. Census and Department of Labor was put together specifically
  to explore the impacts of COVID-19. Maps for Public Policy The National Addresses
