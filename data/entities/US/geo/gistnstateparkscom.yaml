description: 'GIS makes Tennessee State Parks "Smart"

  Tennessee State ParksÂ provide myriad recreational opportunities and preserve unique
  examples of natural and cultural resources. While you''re out at one of our 56 parks
  hiking, fishing, paddling, biking, camping, or participating in our interpretive
  programs, you''ll see stunning waterfalls, mountain vistas, cedar glades, archaeological
  mounds and more. With so many natural features and recreational assets to manage,
  a robust geographic information system (GIS) allows us to keep track of where our
  resources are and how they are related in space and time. We like to call our GIS
  program Smart Parks, because this spatial awareness helps us make smarter management
  decisions. TDEC Public Trails TDEC Public Trails Miles of Trail TDEC Public Access
