description: 'Lawrence Water Transmission Main MS22-0035 The

  City has proactively performed condition assessment and collected operation and

  maintenance (O&amp;M) data on the transmission main system since at least 2008.

  The project is aimed at planning and executing

  condition assessments to extending the useful life of assets as well as developing

  future condition assessments and/or rehabilitation recommendations for 14-inch

  and larger water transmission mains in the Operation Areas of “Central Service”

  and “West Hills”. GOAL: This HUB is for data review and communication for model
  prioritization and inspection results for the transmission main project. Process
  and Approach Iterative The first step in the process is to create a prioritization
  model that is iterated as data is created, reviewed and collected. This includes
  an initial first draft based on existing data, a second draft after review, and
  subsequent drafts as condition assessment or field inspection data is collected.
  Risk Model The risk model is an essential process for prioritization. Selected criteria
  factors such as deterioration or impacts to service, utilizes data to assess individual
  pipe risk for comparison across the targeted 30 miles of metallic mains.  These
  factors and scoring are iterated across the project with various review to produce
  an established risk priority. Decision Logic To aid in prioritization for condition
  assessment, inspection or renewal selections

  a decision logic tree is produced. Mains are assessed according to each

  criteria decision points (diamond boxes). The Logic helps in providing a starting
  point as well as consistent

  and defensible decisions applied to each transmission line. The logic is

  separated into specific paths with the emphasis on renewal or inspections. Assessment
  Options Various assessment and renewal options are available for transmission mains.
  Some methods include external inspections such as field corrosion investigations
  used to identify high deterioration areas within the system. Other internal methods
  are utilized to provide individual pipe condition information to aid in planning
  for cost-effective operational and maintenance and renewal program. Utilize the
