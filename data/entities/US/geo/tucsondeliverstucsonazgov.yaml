description: Tucson Delivers Quad Logo Learn About Our Initiatives Better Streets
  | Safe Streets The Better Streets | Safe Streets program will collect $740 million
  over 10 years to be used solely for improvements to neighborhood street conditions
  and systemwide street safety. Of that estimated funding, $590 million will be dedicated
  to improving the condition of every City neighborhood street and $150 million will
  be dedicated to safe street improvements that benefit all users and modes. City
  icon Safer City The Safer City initiative will provide $150 million for vehicles,
  equipment, and facilities for the Tucson Fire and Police departments. Purchases
  include police patrol cars, fire trucks, ambulances, police motorcycles. A new southside
  police substation, police academy training track, and five fire station rebuilds
  are included in the facilities category. Street icon Better Streets Of the $250
  million projected to be collected for Proposition 101, $100 million is being used
  for road improvements. Of this $100 million, 60 percent will be used for arterial
  road improvements.  The remaining 40 percent will be used for local street improvements.
  Park bench icon Parks + Connections In November 2018, a bond package was approved
  to provide $225 million to improve City parks amenities and connections. Park projects
  include improvements to playgrounds, sports fields, pools, splash pads, and recreation
  centers and other amenities. Connection projects include greenways and shared-use
  paths, pedestrian safety and walkability, and bicycle boulevards. Find Projects
