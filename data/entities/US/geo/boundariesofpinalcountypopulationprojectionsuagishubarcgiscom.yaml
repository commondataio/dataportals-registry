description: 'Data Visualization and Platform Prototype This Hub site connects assured
  water supply designations, available water supply sources, and population projection
  data to support the sustainability of Pinal County communities. Home to a powerful
  ensemble of geospatial data, this collaborative project is supported by Arizona
  Water Company, University of Arizona Water Resources Research Center, Babbitt Center
  of Land and Water Policy, and Center for Geospatial Solutions. Communities, farms,
  and businesses need water to thrive in Pinal County, Arizona. These communities
  understand that they are at risk of returning to groundwater dependence, because
  they maintained an agricultural economy on Colorado River water and grew communities
  on groundwater - both threatened resources.  In order to protect the quality of
  life of this region,  help meet future water needs, and grow economically, collaborative
  efforts are needed to: 1) reduce reliance on groundwater where possible; 2) invest
  in sustainable water supplies, and 3) use available water more efficiently. Breaking
  Down Boundaries: Jurisdictions Matter for Water Management This project will layer
  and compare various boundaries that affect how water can be moved, saved, and used
  most efficiently in Pinal County. Some of these boundaries include: Active Management
  Areas Landownership Municipalities Counties Community water service areas Irrigation
  districts Taxing districts Population projections are an important way that water
  utilities plan for capacity to serve customers reliable and safe water supplies
  now and into the future. In Arizona, there are several authoritative sources of
  population projection data that is also available at a granular scale. The Arizona
  Office of Economic Opportunity 2019-2055 Population Projection Methodology Report
  Document is linked directly on this page. "Arizona Sub-County Population Projections,
  2019 edition, are the second update to the 2013-edition projections that were developed
  by the Office of Employment and Population Statistics (EPS), then a unit at the
  Arizona Department of Administration (ADOA). Methodologies Additional resources
