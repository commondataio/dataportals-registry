description: 'The Nature Conservancy in Illinois is using GIS analysis along with
  conservation planning expertise and stakeholder and community engagement to identify
  where nature based interventions can help address the challenges and impacts of
  climate change. What is a Greenprint? What are the benefits of a Greenprint? A Greenprint
  is a strategic conservation plan and/or tool that reveals that economic and social
  benefits that parks, open space, and working lands provide communities. Such benefits
  include recreation opportunities through the use of parks and trails, habitat protection
  and connectivity, clean water, agricultural land preservation, and increased resilience
  to climate change. Greenprints can: Our Focus Areas Chicago skyline from Northerly
  Island Park. © Laura Stoecker Photography LTD Chicago skyline centered on the Willis
  Tower with autumn trees in the foreground. Chicago and Cook County The Chicago and
  Cook County Greenprint seeks to identify areas where nature can help address climate-related
  challenges, such as extreme flooding, poor air quality and excessive heat. We analyzed
  numerous layers of data to show which Chicago and suburban neighborhoods are most
  at risk for these challenges and show priority places in which to focus conservation
  efforts. Several partners supplied these key data layers, including the Chicago
  Metropolitan Agency for Planning and the Morton Arboretum. Click here to learn more

  River Watershed (Coming Soon!) The Mackinaw River watershed in central Illinois
  is a high-quality river, sustaining high fish and mussel diversity. It maintains
  23% of the highest quality stream segments that remain in the state of Illinois.
  Stresses to the river come from both agricultural and urban sources and include:
  altered hydrology, habitat degradation, and decreased water quality. We are working
  with watershed stakeholders to create a web-based, interactive framework that: Contact
