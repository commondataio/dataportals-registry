description: The Department of Labor enforcement agencies foster and promote the welfare
  of wage earners and retirees of the United States, by ensuring their safety, improving
  their working conditions, and protecting their retirement and health care benefits.
  In carrying out this mission, the Agencies administer and enforce a variety of Federal
  labor laws that guarantee workers’ rights to safe and healthful working conditions,
  a minimum hourly wage and overtime pay, and freedom from employment discrimination,
  as well as the integrity of their pensions and health plans. This site aims to make
  the enforcement data, collected by these agencies in the exercise of their mission,
  accessible and searchable. It intends, also, to engage you the public in new and
  creative ways of using this data.
