description: Forest Service Research & Development (FS R&D) has long recognized the
  usefulness and importance of archiving and sharing the research data it generates.
  This recognition has been expressed in Research Station Quality Assurance (QA) Plans,
  the national QA Implementation Plan, and the Forest Service Manual. The FS Research
  Data Archive provides an infrastructure and the resources to implement sharing and
  preserving our research data.
