description: Manta Matcher represents the first global manta ray database. This site
  was specifically designed to manage manta ray sightings and identifications across
  their distribution. After the success of the Ecocean whale shark database, Manta
  Matcher was a logical follow-up. Manta rays are widely distributed, migratory, and
  have unique spot patterning on their ventral surface that can be used to permanently
  identify individuals. At the present time, this database will enable researchers
  to upload and organize individually identified manta rays in their populations.
  This system is also intended to promote collaborations by way of cross-referencing
  databases to check for both regional and long distance movement.
