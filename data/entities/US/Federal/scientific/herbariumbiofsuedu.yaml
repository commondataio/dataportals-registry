description: Florida State University's Robert K. Godfrey Herbarium is a museum-quality
  collection of over 220,000 plant and microalgae specimens. These document the distribution
  and natural variation of the 2,400 species of flowering plants, ferns, conifers,
  and cycads found in northern Florida-one of North America's biodiversity hotspots-and
  the microalgae of Florida's Gulf and Atlantic coasts. Each plant specimen is carefully
  identified, pressed, dried, and mounted to archival standards, with accompanying
  data on where and when it was collected. The specimens are a valued resource to
  local, state, national, and international biologists studying plant and microalgae
  systematics, ecology, evolution, biogeography, conservation biology, anatomy, and
  morphology. New specimens are added to the collection each week. As of May 2014,
  the collection includes all specimens from Stetson University's Herbarium (DLF).
  In August 2003, Austin Mast became the new director of the herbarium.
