description: QDR curates, stores, preserves, publishes, and enables the download of
  digital data generated through qualitative and multi-method research in the social
  sciences. The repository develops and disseminates guidance for managing, sharing,
  citing, and reusing qualitative data, and contributes to the generation of common
  standards for doing so. QDRâ€™s overarching goals are to make sharing qualitative
  data customary in the social sciences, to broaden access to social science data,
  and to strengthen qualitative and multi-method research.
