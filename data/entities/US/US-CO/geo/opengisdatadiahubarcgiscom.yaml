  \ Plan? An ALP, which is a public document that serves as a record of present\n\
  \ and future aeronautical requirements, is a blueprint for airport \ndevelopment\
  \ by which the airport sponsor – in this case, the sponsor is \nthe City and County\
  \ of Denver – can ensure that development remains \nconsistent with airport design\
  \ standards and safety requirements, as \nwell as airport and community land use\
  \ plans. FAA regulations dictate that an ALP remains current for a five-year \n\
  period unless major changes at the airport are made or planned.(FlyDenver.com) presentation\
  \ of the existing and future airport facilities and their \nlocation on the airport\
  \ campus.  The ALP is a major product of the Master Plan Update which\n contains\
  \ information used by the FAA to program future funding \nassistance and to monitor\
  \ the airport’s compliance with design standards\n and grant assurances. It also\
  \ allows the FAA to anticipate budgetary \nand procedural needs, and to protect\
  \ the airspace required for facility \nor aircraft approach procedure improvements.\
  \ An up-to-date FAA-approved\n ALP that ensures the safety, utility, and efficiency\
  \ of the Airport is \nrequired for the Airport to receive financial assistance under\
  \ the terms\n of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (AIP) and to be\
  \ able \nto receive specific Passenger Facility Charge funding. Denver International\
