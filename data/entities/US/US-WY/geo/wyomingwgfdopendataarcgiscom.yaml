  maintains this site as an alternative to our Geospatial Data web page, but with
  this Open Data site, you will have a richer and more interactive experience. For
  example, you can review the description of a data set and preview the data itself
  (tabular and map form) before downloading to help ensure you are getting what you
  expect. You can also summarize attribute data in one of several chart styles, and
  even embed the selected chart in a website. Selected data sets can be added to "My
  Favorites" for quick reference. Get Started! Using This Site Use the search bar
  above to find data about a specific topic of interest; click on the magnify button
  to return a full listing of data. Or, click on a data category below to find data
  about that particular topic. Hovering over a data set name on the page of results
  will highlight the spatial extent on the map. Clicking on a data set name opens
  an item details page with that data added to the map interface, shares information
  about the data, and allows for the download of either the full data set or a filtered
  subset. Downloading Data Data can be downloaded from the item details page in the
  following formats: shapefile, KML and spreadsheet (CSV). An API link is also available
  for users interested in embedding data in other applications with feature service
  link or GeoJson. Note - shapefiles downloaded from this site do not include the
  structured metadata file typically associated with shapefiles, but rather a separate
  XML file (the contents of which can then be imported back to the shapefile on the
  client side). Story Maps Story maps provide a unique format for sharing maps, photos
  and narratives to "tell a story" in a single electronic document.  This engaging
  format is also an Esri product, in which we have customized and configured the contents
  of templates made available by Esri.  Please check out our story maps: Explore Data
