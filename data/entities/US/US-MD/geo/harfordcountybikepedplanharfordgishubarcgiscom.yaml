description: HarfordNEXT, the county master plan, called for the 2013 Bicycle and
  Pedestrian Master Plan to be reviewed and updated, to ensure efforts to extend the
  network of non-motorized facilities are synchronized with other land use and transportation
  decisions. This plan analyzes corridors and lays out 220 bicycle and pedestrian
  plans to guide capital planning and review of development proposals for years to
  come. The draft plan will be open for public comment and suggestions through the
  end of October 2021. The plan will then be adjusted to incorporate feedback. The
  final plan will become the policy of the Harford County Department of Planning and
