description: Notice to Open Baltimore Users We are improving the Open Baltimore platform.
  Migrating our data assets to the cloud will increase reliability. Often, this will
  create new URLs for each dataset. If you link to individual dataset pages or use
  the API to gain access, please update your URLs. Review this Migration Schedule and
  update your links where necessary. Thank you for your working with us to grow a
  data-driven culture in the City! Welcome to Open Baltimore. On this site you will
  find hundreds of datasets published by the city and our partners for greater transparency,
  accountability and access. The City of Baltimore invites you to interact with the
  data by using our dashboards, download content, analyze data, or build apps using
  our APIs. Check back frequently as new content, dashboards, and data governance
  information will be added as we work together to build a more open and accountable
  city. Featured Content More Insights Discover key insights about our city and how
