  \ Census Boundary Files Access the U.S. Census Bureau's GIS TIGER/Line files for\
  \ Census geographies, including blocks, block groups, tracts, zip code tabulation\
  \ areas, and more via web interface or FTP. About Community Statistical Areas (CSAs)\
  \ Why does BNIA-JFI use Community Statistical Areas (CSAs) and how were they devised?\
  \ BNIA-JFI uses the 55 Community Statistical Areas (CSAs) to present a \nwide range\
  \ of data from multiple sources as well as providing data for \nBaltimore City in\
  \ a consistent way over time.  Clustering neighborhoods \ninto CSAs was necessary \
  \ since most of the 270+ neighborhoods in \nBaltimore City do not have boundaries\
  \ that fall along census tracts. As \nthe city changes, Baltimore residents may\
  \ shift their neighborhood’s \nboundaries or even change its name. Neighborhood\
  \ lines often do not fall\n along CSA boundaries but CSAs are a  consistent representation\
  \ of the \nconditions occurring within particular neighborhoods. The CSAs were initially\
  \ designed by the Baltimore Data Collaborative \nwith the Baltimore City Department\
  \ of Planning. Four guidelines were \nestablished for constructing the CSAs: What’s\
  \ the difference between a Census Tract, a neighborhood (Neighborhood Statistical\
  \ Area), and a CSA? Changes to Community Statistical Areas (CSAs) Over Time Every\
  \ decade, the U.S. Census Bureau has the option to make modifications to its Census\
  \ Tract boundaries based on results of the decennial Census. BNIA-JFI's CSAs geographies\
  \ are based on Census tracts so when changes are implemented, BNIA-JFI must make\
  \ alterations if needed. Every decade is also an opportunity to review the names\
  \ of CSAs to ensure that the label is appropriate for the area, given its unique\
  \ identity and history. 2010 to 2020 In 2021 with the release of new Census Tract\
  \ definitions, BNIA-JFI made the decision to maintain the existing geographic boundaries\
  \ of its CSAs. Two Census Tracts contained within the Poppleton Community were merged\
  \ but no other major changes occurred to impact overall CSAs. In the Spring of 2022,\
  \ BNIA-JFI finalized name adjustments to seven CSAs going forward. Again, there\
  \ were NO boundary changes from 2010 to 2020. You can read more about the process\
  \ on our blog post. The table below details the changes. 2000 to 2020 From 2000\
  \ to 2010 there were boundary changes in Census Tracts which impacted the CSAs.\
  \ The graphic below, click to enlarge, details the modifications which allowed for\
  \ the creation of the Oldtown/Middle East and Harbor East/Little Italy CSAs. Cllick\
