  team implemented a interactive web GIS based Citizen Problem Reporter application. 
  It has been a great success, not only in furthering our goals towards public engagement
  and transparency, but also empowering the citizens to drive change in these disconnected
  times.  Anything from a burnt-out streetlight or pothole to missed trash pick-up
  can be reported through the new application, which also provides updates to citizens
  as City teams work to correct the problem. Click to launch Citizen Reporter Aerial
