description: 'Providing Spatial Solutions For Stark County And Its Residents Stark
  County GIS (SCGIS) maintains a multi-agency enterprise GIS for not only county departments,
  but for Stark''s cities, villages, and townships as well. We provide GIS infrastructure,
  services, solutions, and leadership to meet the needs of those agencies, as well
  as those of the general public. Frequently Used Applications What is GIS? A Geographic
  Information System (GIS) is a computer system that inputs, edits, stores, maintains,
  manages, retrieves, analyzes, and outputs geographically-referenced information.
  GIS supports applications such as emergency dispatch, emergency management, land
  planning, property appraisal, civil engineering, natural resource monitoring, transportation
  planning, monitoring crime and accidents, public health and environmental analysis,
  economic development, census analysis, and much more. It is estimated that more
  than 80% of government functions are associated with managing information about
  specific locations or geographic areas that can then be utilized by GIS. It is important
  to note that GIS provides accurate digital base maps, allowing different layers
  to be created, displayed, and/or queried. This in turn, allows GIS users to lower
  their expenses by improving productivity. The majority of the benefits in Stark
  County will stem from the use of the three base layers: parcels, streets, and addresses.
  Within the GIS local government community, the parcel layer is often chosen as the
  base layer due to the complete coverage over the land''s surface. Some specific
  efficiencies of using GIS include:'
