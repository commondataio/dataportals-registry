description: The City of Topeka’s Open Budget application provides an opportunity
  for citizens and other stakeholders to visually interact with the City of Topeka’s
  operating and capital budgets. In addition to this online Open Budget application,
  the city publishes budget documents that meet the criteria established by the Government
  Finance Officers Association (GFOA). Introduction to the Budget Carefully managing
  finances is as important for the City as it is for a household. However, unlike
  a household budget, the City's budget is similar to a collection of checking accounts
  rather than a single account. The City maintains more than 40 of these accounts
  (known as "funds") and each are considered a separate accounting and reporting entity.
  Some funds are required by generally accepted accounting principles, some are required
  by State law, and some the City creates for its own internal financial management.
  Kansas law does not permit cities to spend money they do not have, except for properly
  authorized debt transactions. As a result, the resources available to the fund balances
  carried over plus current year revenues, must equal or exceed planned expenditures.
