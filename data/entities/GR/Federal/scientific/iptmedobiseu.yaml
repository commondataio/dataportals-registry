description: We are running IPT behind an apache server. Both servers (apache and
  tomcat) are debian virtual machines running under KVM. The KVM hosts are 2 dual
  Xeon X5600 machines with 48GB RAM and FiberChannel connections to SANs for storage.
  Physicaly, they are located at HCMR's server room at Heraklion and are supervised
  by the center's NOC team.
