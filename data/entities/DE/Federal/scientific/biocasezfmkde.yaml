description: "The Leibniz Institute for the Analysis of Biodiversity Change (LIB)\
  \ is dedicated to research into biological diversity and how it changes, the findings\
  \ from which have illuminating relevance for society as a whole. To better understand\
  \ current mass extinction of flora and fauna, scientists look for correlations and\
  \ causes of – often – human-made change. The goal is to find solutions for the conservation\
  \ of ecosystems and species in order to preserve the basis of life as we currently\
  \ know it.\r\n\r\nThe LIB is one of the eight natural history research museums of\
  \ the Leibniz Association. It comprises the Zoological Research Museum Alexander\
  \ Koenig – Leibniz Institute for Animal Biodiversity (Museum Koenig), Bonn, and\
  \ the former Centre of Natural History (CeNak) of the University of Hamburg."
