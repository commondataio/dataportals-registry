description: Pandora promotes data communities and networking. It offers new tools
  to handle and model data plus AI methods to investigate historical causation. Pandora
  seeks a better understanding of the human story by offering technological solutions
  to make historical and archaeological data more accessible and easily findable.
  It is a grassroots initiative where research communities from across various academic
  disciplines self-curate datasets and self-manage community membership and roles.
  These datasets may be deposited externally or within the Pandora data platform itself.
  Datasets can be assigned DOIs and are indexed so that they are findable using scientific
  search engines.
