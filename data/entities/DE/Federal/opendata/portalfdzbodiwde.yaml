description: The FDZ-BO at DIW Berlin is a central archive for quantitative and qualitative
  operational and organizational data. It archives these, informs about their existence
  and provides datasets for secondary analytical purposes. The archiving of studies
  and datasets ensures long-term security and long-term availability of the data.
  In consultation with the responsible scientists, access to individual datasets is
  made possible as scientific use files, via remote data processing or as part of
  guest stays. The FDZ-BO offers detailed information on current research projects
  and develops concepts for research data management of organizational data.
