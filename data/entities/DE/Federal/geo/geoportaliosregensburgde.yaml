description: A cartographic information system in which maps as knowledge repositories
  are adequately represented in both their geographic and semantic dimensions. Maps—mainly
  from 19th and 20th century works on Eastern and Southeastern Europe—are digitized,
  georeferenced, and enriched with metadata and contextual data. The system allows
  visual and term-independent search and supports aggregation and reuse of digital
  map objects using Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies.
