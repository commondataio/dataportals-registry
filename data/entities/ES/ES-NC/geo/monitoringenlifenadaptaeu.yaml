description: 'Navarra is adapting to Climate Change Monitoring indicators portal The
  LIFE-IP-NADAPTA-CC project "Integrated strategy for adaptation to climate change
  in Navarra" aims to design and implement measures to adapt Navarra to the effects
  of climate change. Within the project, this platform allows to assess the territorial
  impact of the effects of climate change in Navarra Project actions System for monitoring
  the effects of climate change in Navarra LIFE NAdapta. Project actions This interactive
  dashboard shows: This information is displayed in the form of graphs, web maps with
  pop-up windows, indicators and list of details for municipality. To facilitate access
  to the data, a municipality selector has been enabled in the header on the right.
  LIFE NAdapta. Action C1.1 The main objective of the LIFE-IP NAdapta-CC project,
  “Integrated strategy for adapting to climate change in Navarra”, is to increase
  Navarra’s resilience in the face of climate change. To achieve this, various measures
  have been proposed to enable Navarra to adapt to the effects of climate change,
  in the form of 53 action points. Action point C1.1. “Indicator system for monitoring
  the effects of climate change in Navarra” aims to design and develop a dashboard
  to evaluate the territorial impact of climate change in Navarra. This action will
  show the situation and developments in Navarra with regards to climate change, and
  will make possible to quantify the effect of the adaptive solutions and changes
  implemented. Situation map of Navarra Key indicators of climate change adaptation
  In terms of adaptation, the general aim is to ensure that Navarra is resilient to
  the effects of climate change, along with the specific objectives of the LIFE-NAdapta
  sectors in monitoring, water, forests, agriculture, health, infrastructure and land
  planning. To achieve this, the following specific adaptation aims have been defined:
  To maximize and facilitate administrative coordination (via Covenant of Mayors)To
  monitor climate variability in NavarraTo monitor the effects of climate change Maximize
  and facilitate the administrative coordination Monitoring the climate variability

  and precipitation Key adaptation indicators Monitoring climate change through impact
  chains What is an impact chain? A climate impact chain reflects the interrelationship
  between a climate stimulus and a recipient. Impact chains allow us to record the
  cause and effect relationships between a specific climate threat (current or future)
  and a specific sector, system or recipient. For example, we can look at the impact
  of the threat of “increasing temperatures” on the “health” sector, which would give
  us the impact chain “increasing temperatures on health”. Floods Water supply and
