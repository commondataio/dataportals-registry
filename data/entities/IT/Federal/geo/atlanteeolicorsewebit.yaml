description: The goal of AEOLIAN is, therefore, to provide an anemological database
  on the Italian territory that can be consulted through an easily usable WebGIS tool
  in order to constitute a tangible support to energy planning for various stakeholders,
  such as wind farm builders, authorities responsible for territorial planning, companies
  involved in the development of the electricity grid or even private citizens.
