description: 'Environmental Agency for Mineral Resource Activities (EAMRA) Greenland
  Institute of Natural Resources (GINR) &amp; Danish Center for Environment and Energy
  (DCE) The regional environmental baseline assessments (RBA) of mining activities
  in Greenland are based on a project idea developed between Environmental Agency
  for Mineral Resource Activities (EAMRA), Greenland Institute of Natural Resources
  (GINR) and DCE (AU). The purpose of the project is to provide a basis for supporting
  environmentally sound planning and regulation of mining activities by summarising
  existing regional background information supplemented with new studies and making
  these results operational and easily accessible. View the Regional Baseline Assessment
