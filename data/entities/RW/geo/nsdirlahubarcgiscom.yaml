  the datasets The datasets presented on this page were gathered from different

  government organizations in Rwanda. This was done in the framework of the

  2020 Basemap Review, which was conducted alongside the National

  Land Use Development Master Plan 2020-2050. During the Basemap Review, many data
  sets were gathered,

  cleaned, and harmonized. However, due to limited resources, the datasets were

  not completely updated. In 2021, Rwanda Land Management and Use Authority in

  collaboration with other government institutions, has acquired high-resolution

  satellites images, which, later, have been used to update different layers. Even
  though the updating processes are still ongoing, most of the datasets on this page
  are open for use, free of charge. Rwanda Land Management and Use Authority will
  notify the users whenever new updates are available. The users who would prefer
  to download and use the data offline are advised to always check for new updates
  before downloading the layers of their interest. For anyone using the services for
  digital mapping (web apps, interactive maps, ...), there is no need to check for
  new updates, since the services will be seamlessly updated. All the users are also
  encouraged to report any errors or any needed updates. In the same way, users are
  encouraged to contribute the data for the interest of all. Happy Mapping! Boundaries
