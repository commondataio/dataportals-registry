description: The FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology has taken over management
  of the monitoring projects previously housed at the Animal Demography Unit (formerly
  the Avian Demography Unit), or ADU as it is mostly known in the vernacular. The
  ADU is a research unit of the University of Cape Town, initially built on the nucleus
  of the South African Bird Ringing Unit (SAFRING) and the Southern African Bird Atlas
  Project (SABAP). The ADU was established in December 1991 within the Department
  of Statistical Sciences at the University of Cape Town. Over the years, the ADU
  has grown far beyond its starting point. In January 2008 the ADU was formally transferred
  to the Deparment of Zoology, which in 2013 merged with the Botany Department into
  the Department of Biological Sciences.
