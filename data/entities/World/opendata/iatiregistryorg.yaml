description: The IATI Registry is the place to register your organisation and IATI
  datasets. It provides a central point to access all IATI data files and import them
  into IATI data-use tools. The Registry stores information on every organisation
  publishing IATI data, called 'IATI publishers', and holds metadata about each publisher
  and the files they have published in IATI XML format. Users can search and download
  data files, view metadata, and use the Registry API for programmatic access.
