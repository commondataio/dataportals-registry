description: The ADB Data Library is a comprehensive open data portal operated by the Asian Development Bank that provides free access to development statistics, economic indicators, project information, and financial data covering countries across Asia and the Pacific region. The portal offers datasets, visualizations, and analytical tools covering key development themes including infrastructure development, poverty reduction, climate change adaptation and mitigation, gender equality, education, health, energy, transport, water resources, and urban development. Data is available through a RESTful JSON API, enabling programmatic access for researchers, policymakers, and developers. The portal supports evidence-based decision-making and transparency in development finance by making ADB's project data, country statistics, and research findings publicly accessible in machine-readable formats.
