description: DoltHub is where people collaboratively build, manage, and distribute
  Dolt databases. Dolt is the world's first and only version controlled database,
  SQL database you can fork, clone, branch, merge, push and pull just like a Git repository.
  DoltHub adds a modern, secure, always on database management web GUI to the Dolt
  ecosystem. Edit your database on the web, have another person review it via a pull
  request, and have the production database pull it to deploy.
