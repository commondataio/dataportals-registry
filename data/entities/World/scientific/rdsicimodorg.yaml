description: "The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD)\
  \ is a regional intergovernmental learning and knowledge sharing centre serving\
  \ the eight regional member countries of the Hindu Kush Himalaya – Afghanistan,\
  \ Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan – and based in\
  \ Kathmandu, Nepal. Globalization and climate change have an increasing influence\
  \ on the stability of fragile mountain ecosystems and the livelihoods of mountain\
  \ people. ICIMOD aims to assist mountain people to understand these changes, adapt\
  \ to them, and make the most of new opportunities, while addressing upstream-downstream\
  \ issues.\r\nWe support regional transboundary programmes through partnerships with\
  \ regional partner institutions, facilitate the exchange of experience, and serve\
  \ as a regional knowledge hub. We strengthen networking among regional and global\
  \ centres of excellence. Overall, we are working to develop an economically and\
  \ environmentally sound mountain ecosystem to improve the living standards of mountain\
  \ populations and to sustain vital ecosystem services for the billions of people\
  \ living downstream, now and for the future."
