description: Demo instance of gvSIG Online geoportal providing comprehensive access
  to geospatial datasets and map layers through a GeoNetwork-based metadata catalog.
  The platform supports multiple standard protocols including CSW (Catalog Service
  for the Web), OpenSearch, OAI-PMH (Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata
  Harvesting), and OpenAPI. This demonstration instance showcases the capabilities
  of gvSIG Online, an open-source web-based GIS platform for managing, sharing, and
  visualizing geospatial data and services. The portal enables users to discover,
  access, and integrate spatial information through standardized web services and
  APIs, supporting both ISO 19115 metadata standards and OGC service protocols for
  interoperability. Users can search, browse, and access geospatial resources including
  vector and raster datasets, web map services (WMS), web feature services (WFS),
  and other OGC-compliant services. The platform facilitates metadata management,
  data discovery, and spatial data infrastructure (SDI) implementation through its
  comprehensive cataloging and service capabilities. This demo portal serves as a
  reference implementation for organizations seeking to deploy gvSIG Online for geospatial
  data management, offering full-featured access to metadata catalogs, spatial data
  services, and web-based mapping tools.
