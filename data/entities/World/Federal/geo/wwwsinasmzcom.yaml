description: Geoportal of the Sistema Nacional de Águas e Saneamento (SINAS) providing
  comprehensive access to geospatial datasets and interactive map layers for water
  resources and sanitation information in Mozambique. The portal uses Lizmap web mapping
  application to publish and share QGIS projects and geospatial data catalogs online,
  enabling users to discover, visualize, and access spatial data related to water
  resources management, sanitation infrastructure, water supply networks, wastewater
  treatment facilities, water quality monitoring, hydrological data, watershed boundaries,
  and related environmental datasets. The platform supports data discovery, visualization,
  and download capabilities for researchers, policymakers, and water sector professionals
  working on water and sanitation projects in Mozambique.
