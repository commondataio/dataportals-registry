description: The Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) is an open source effort providing a robust, distributed data and computation platform, enabling worldwide access to Peta/Exa-scale scientific data. ESGF is a collaboration that develops, deploys and maintains software infrastructure for the management, dissemination, and analysis of model output and observational data, primarily to facilitate advancements in Earth System Science. It is an interagency and international effort led by the Department of Energy (DOE), and co-funded by NASA, NOAA, NSF, and international laboratories. ESGF provides access to climate model data including CMIP (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) datasets used for IPCC assessments.
