description: This beta version of the UN Sustainable Development Group Data Portal
  showcases information on UN teams’ work for the Sustainable Development Goals in
  162 countries and territories. The data is drawn from UN INFO, a digital platform
  used by UN Country teams to boost transparency and accountability for development
  coordination, managed by the UN Development Coordination Office (DCO). While the
  datasets are not yet complete for all countries, DCO is working with all UN country
  teams to address data gaps and to ensure that the information is kept up to date.
