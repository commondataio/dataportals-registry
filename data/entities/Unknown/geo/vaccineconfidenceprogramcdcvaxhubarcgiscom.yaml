description: "COVID-19 Vaccination Mapping Tool:     Local Data for COVID-19 Vaccine\
  \ Planning Note: The vaccination indicators in this tool reflect recommendations\
  \ prior to the guidance released on April 19, 2023 available here. This COVID-19\
  \ Vaccination Mapping Tool is an exploratory data product. This geographic information\
  \ system (GIS) tool allows jurisdictions and other partners to use web maps, applications,\
  \ and services to inform planning for vaccine-related activities. This tool allows\
  \ users to better understand the local-level indicators that contribute to vaccine\
  \ confidence and vaccination coverage, visualize data for populations at increased\
  \ risk, identify community resources and barriers, and connect community stakeholders.\
  \  \nThis tool was designed based on feedback from CDC stakeholders along with health\
  \ planners and data analysts from several local health departments. Please email\
  \ VaxView@cdc.gov to share any feedback. Vaccine Activity Planner The Vaccine Activity\
  \ Planner and its underlying data layers are designed for state and local health\
  \ departments, community-based organizations, and other partners to plan vaccination\
  \ activities. This application contains layers of sociodemographic indicators that\
  \ can be mapped with measures of vaccine confidence, access, and vaccination coverage,\
  \ as well as points of interests for planning potential vaccine activities. People\
  \ using this tool can explore other publicly available layers in the Esri Living\
  \ Atlas. STEP 1 STEP 2 STEP 3 STEP 4 Search for your area. Explore layer list. Add\
  \ data from ESRI Living Atlas. Select, Filter, and Analyze. Vaccine Activity Planner\

  \ the bottom. Highlighted Datasets These are a series of map layers that can be\
  \ explored to better understand social, economic, and demographic correlates of\
  \ vaccine uptake within your community. Note that all the layers are also explorable\
  \ through the Vaccine Activity Planner above. See more datasets in the content library here.\
