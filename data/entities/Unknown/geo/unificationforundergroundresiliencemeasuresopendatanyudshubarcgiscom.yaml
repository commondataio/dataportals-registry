description: 'UNUM Open DataNew York University Discover free public data, tools,
  and resources from New York University - UNUM open data layer initiative GOAL The
  Unification for Underground Resilience Measures Open Data Content is a comprehensive
  compilation of open data layers sourced from federal, state, and city open data
  repositories. This collection focuses on data layers that directly impact subsurface
  utilities, provide indications about subsurface layers, or threaten subsurface infrastructure''s
  resilience. This open data initiative aims to address the challenges associated
  with subsurface infrastructure management and enhance understanding of potential
  risks and vulnerabilities. This comprehensive dataset enables stakeholders, researchers,
  and policymakers to make informed decisions and develop effective strategies to
  mitigate potential risks by unifying diverse open data layers related to subsurface
  utilities and layers. The Unification for Underground Resilience Measures Open Data
  Content includes geospatial information, such as geotechnical data, geological surveys,
  geophysical data, utility network information, groundwater levels, land use planning
  data, and other relevant layers. These layers provide insights into subsurface layers''
  characteristics, conditions, and interactions, offering valuable information for
  urban planning, infrastructure development, and risk assessment. The dataset is
  sourced from reliable and authoritative open data repositories at the federal, state,
  and city levels, ensuring the quality and credibility of the information. The data
  is carefully curated, validated, and organized to facilitate ease of access and
  analysis for users. By promoting the availability and accessibility of open data
  related to subsurface utilities and layers, the Unification for Underground Resilience
  Measures Open Data initiative supports evidence-based decision-making, fosters stakeholder
  collaboration, and contributes to developing resilient and sustainable urban environments.
  This initiative encourages innovation and research in subsurface infrastructure
  management while empowering communities to better prepare for and respond to potential
  threats or disruptions to subsurface layers. Note: The actual dataset may contain
  specific details about the available open data layers, data formats, and access
  methods. Browse Data by Category There''s a lot to see here, so feel free to peruse
