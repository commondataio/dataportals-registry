  WHAT IS GIS? A geographic information system (GIS) is a system that creates, manages,
  analyzes, and maps all types of data. GIS connects data to a map, integrating location
  data (where things are) with all types of descriptive information (what things are
  like there). This provides a foundation for mapping and analysis that is used in
  science and almost every industry. GIS helps users understand patterns, relationships,
  and geographical context. The benefits include improved communication and efficiency
  as well as better management and decision-making. - ESRI Who Can Benefit From GIS?
