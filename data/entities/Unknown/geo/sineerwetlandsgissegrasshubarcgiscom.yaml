description: Explore the Barrier Island Sapelo Island is a Pleistocene barrier island
  located close to the center of the roughly 100-mile long Georgia coast and is the
  fourth largest of Georgia’s fourteen major barrier islands. In recent years, coastal
  freshwater resources (freshwater wetlands) have become scarcer as anthropological
  demand increases. Amphibian populations are in a global decline due to habitat loss
  and fragmentation. This wetlands monitoring project uses geospatial technology and
  in-field verification to identify and monitor all known and potential wetlands on
  Sapelo Island. Explore the map to discover the island's location and relevant information
  about the island's features to this project. Explore the Maps Learn about the Sapelo
