description: 'Welcome to the City of Gold Coast Data Portal This site provides access
  to all of our published open data. The City of Gold Coast''s Open Data Portal can
  help you access our GIS data. With Open Data Portal, you can view it, map it, style
  it, chart it, download it or share it. How you use it is entirely up to you. Council
  administration Local government is responsible for providing a number of products
  and services to the community. To deliver these, City of Gold Coast uses a number
  of ''administration'' datasets, such as suburb boundaries, divisional boundaries,
  land parcels and local government boundaries. View details » Environment We are
  working to protect our landscapes and wildlife, recognising the critical importance
  of healthy and diverse natural environments in shaping a strong and sustainable
  future. The data used to support initiatives in this area includes information on
  fauna, flora and bushfire hazards. View details » Parks and recreation The Gold
  Coast has more than 2200 parks covering 14,000 hectares, almost 700 playgrounds,
  over 380 barbecues and over 200 sports fields. This theme includes data about parks,
  barbecues, playgrounds, shelters, showers, tables, bins and other facilities within
  our parks and open spaces. View details » Planning and building City planning is
  a critical tool in shaping the Gold Coast into a mature, world-class city. To perform
  this function efficiently a number of information sources are used including zones,
  building heights, minimum lot size, residential density, flood areas and other related
  planning material. View details » Stormwater Stormwater is rainwater that runs off
  surfaces such as lawns, roads, roofs, car parks and natural ground surfaces. We
  maintain stormwater infrastructure to prevent flooding. Datasets that we use to
  manage stormwater, including drainage pipes, pits, detention basins, are available
  here. View details » Transport To provide a balanced transport system with managed
  road space, infrastructure for cycling and walking, extensions of the rail network
  and improved bus services, we use the following datasets for transport planning:
  road segments, pram ramps, road closures, vehicle access, kerb and channel. These
  are available here. View details » Water and sewer To protect our community’s health
  and lifestyle and help build future prosperity, we are responsible for providing
  safe, reliable water and sewerage services, in cooperation with South East Queensland
  Water (Seqwater). This theme contains datasets such as the pipe network and hydrant
  locations. View details »'
