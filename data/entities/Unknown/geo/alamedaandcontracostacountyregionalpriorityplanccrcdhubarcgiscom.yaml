description: 'Alameda and Contra Costa County Regional Priority Plan Protecting our
  Natural Resources through Wildfire Mitigation Planning Welcome to the Alameda and
  Contra Costa County Regional Priority Plan website. This site provides updated information,
  links, and maps relevant to the development of the Regional Priority Plan (RPP).
  The Alameda and Contra Costa County Regional Wildfire Prevention Plan was developed
  by Alameda and Contra Costa County Stakeholders from November 2020 through July
  2022. The final version of this Regional Priority Plan is available in two PDF formats,
  one with maps, and one without maps. Note that the version with maps included is
  approximately 57.5 MB while the version without maps is approximately 7.3 MB. Alameda
  County and Contra Costa Resource Conservation Districts would like to thank our
  stakeholders for engaging in this process with us and developing the first Regional
  Wildfire Prevention Plan in our region. We look forward to working with you in the
  future to implement this plan, reduce wildfire, and protect natural resources. For
  comments or questions, please email regionalpriorityplan@ccrcd.org or regionalpriorityplan@acrcd.org.
  What''s Here How to Use the Hub Page Frequently Asked Questions Never heard of a
  Regional Priority Plan or have questions? No problem! See the section below on commonly
  asked questions How can I get involved? What is an RPP and why do we need one? How
  long will this process take? Who is funding this &amp; who is working on this? What
  are the outcomes of an RPP? The RPP will describe the existing conditions of the
  wildlands in the two counties as well as recommend a set of priority projects aimed
  at reducing risk and damage to sensitive resources and communities. Having a RPP
  is a key requirement for continuing and expanding the region’s funding for wildfire
  mitigation related project opportunities The RPP development process began in March
  of 2020, and was completed in September 2022. Alameda and Contra Costa County Resource
  Conservation Districts received a grant from the Coastal Conservancy to develop
  the RPP. This grant is supported by the Regional Forest and Fire Capacity Program,
  run by the Department of Conservation on Behalf of the California Natural Resources
  Agency. Both RCD’s, with consultation support from Wildland Resource Management,
  have been collaborating on this project. A team of stakeholders across both counties
  was created to provide feedback and insight as the RPP process moves along. After
  completing the RPP development process, we will have a viable, vetted portfolio
  of fire-mitigation projects that are ready to undergo further planning &amp; permitting,
  and eventually implementation! Working across jurisdictions with all stakeholders
  will also yield a collaborative and comprehensive understanding of fire hazards
  and priority areas for multiple agencies across both counties. Please contact the
  RCDs if your agency would like to appoint a stakeholder to our stakeholder group
  by emailing: regionalpriorityplan@ccrcd.org or regionalpriorityplan@acrcd.org Funding
  for this project comes from the California Coastal Conservancy through the Regional
  Forest and Fire Capacity Program. This program is administered by the Department
  of Conservation on behalf of the California Natural Resources Agency, and is supported
  by the California Climate Investments funds. Contact Us Alameda County Resource
