description: 'Past Snapshot of  COVID cases What You Can Do to Prevent Illness There
  is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best
  way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. The virus is thought
  to spread mainly from person-to-person: It may be possible that a person can get
  COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching
  their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the
  main way the virus spreads. Older adults and people who have severe underlying chronic
  medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk
  for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness. Please consult
  with your health care provider about additional steps you may be able to take to
  protect yourself. Take Steps to Protect Yourself and Others What to do if you are
  sick See all steps from the CDC here Call your doctor:  If you think you have been
  exposed to COVID-19 and develop a fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, such
  as cough or difficulty breathing, call your healthcare provider immediately. Stay
  Home except to get medical care Separate yourself from other people and animals
  in your home Call ahead before visiting a doctor Cover your coughs and clean your
  hands often . Local Healthcare Resources Local Updates and More Local Closures Information

  Resources Frequently Asked Questions See also the CDC''s general COVID-19 Novel
  Coronavirus FAQ. What is a novel coronavirus? What is the source of the virus? Will
  warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19? What should healthcare professionals
  and health departments do? A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not
  been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
  is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause
  mild illness, like the common cold. A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43,
  or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be
  evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis.
  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others,
  such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses
  that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people.
  This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East
  Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two
  other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to
  people. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on
  the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus. It is not yet known whether
  weather and temperature impact the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like
  the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not
  mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  At
  this time, it is not known whether the spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather
  becomes warmer.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity,
  and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing. See
  the FAQ for Healthcare Professionals from the CDC for more information.'
