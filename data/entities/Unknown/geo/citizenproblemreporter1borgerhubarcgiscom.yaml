  Frequently Asked Questions Below you will find some of the Citizen Problem Center''s
  most commonly asked questions.If you have further questions, please contact the
  Code Enforcement Department by phone (806) 273-0908 or email tpayne@borgertx.gov.
  Can I track the status of my problem report? Do I have to provide my name when I
  submit a problem report? How do I provide feedback after the problem has been resolved?
  Does the Code Enforcement handle emergency services? Yes, you can search for your
  problem report and check the status of your report at any time. No, you can remain
  anonymous when you submit a problem report. However, responsible agencies may want
  to follow up so providing contact information often ensures problems can be resolved
  more quickly. If you share your email address with us, we’ll send you a satisfaction
  survey after the work has been completed. No, the Code Enforcement department only
  handles non-emergency problem reports.  Call 911 in the case of an emergency (burning
  house, accident, robbery, crime in progress, etc.)'
