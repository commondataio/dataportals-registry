description: 'National Forest Inventory The National Forest Inventory (NFI) is a rolling
  programme designed to provide accurate information about the size, distribution,
  composition and condition of the forests and woodlands of Great Britain, and the
  changes taking place within them over time. If you would like to know more about
  the NFI, further information can be found here. On this site you can download NFI
  open datasets, subdivided both by year and by nation. Alternatively, if you are
  interested in more localised geographic areas and/or specific classifications of
  forest coverage, you can search these using the dashboards linked below. Note: Prior
  to 2009 other survey programmes, usually called "Census of Woodlands", were used
  in place of the NFI to track the condition of the nation''s forests and woodlands. Information
  on these previous surveys are available here. Download NFI Datasets Datasets available
