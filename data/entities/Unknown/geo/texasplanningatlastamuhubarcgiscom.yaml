  Hazard Reduction &amp; Recovery Center

  Texas A&amp;M University Texas Atlas Project The Atlas research began as part of
  the

  Texas Sustainable Coastal Initiative started at the Hazard Reduction &amp; Recovery
  Center (HRRC) and later as a joint initiative

  between the HRRC and the Center for Texas Beaches and Shores at Texas

  A&amp;M Galveston over the years funds from various agencies including NSF,

  NOAA/TX Seagrant, FEMA/USACE, TX General Land Office, and the Coastal Services

  Center/NOAA have support this research, the development of data products, and

  the various atlas platforms including the Texas Coastal Atlas, The Texas Atlas,

  and Hurricane Evacuation Study Atlases. During the last few years, the major

  sources of funding have come from FEMA and the United States Army Corp of

  Engineers who have funded a series of Hurricane Evacuation Studies (HES) in the

  Rio Grande Valley and in the Coastal Bend regions.


  The following links provide access to

  various geospatial data sets and data products produced and refined as part of

  these HES studies. In addition, links to the reports from these studies can be

  found at the bottom of this page. The Atlas research began as part of the
