description: 'Navigating Disasters with the Office of Community Services When disaster
  strikes, even the best plans get

  upended. However, the Office of Community Services (OCS) is here to help. OCS''
  block grant funding has built in flexibility to support grant recipients in

  disaster response. On this page, you will find resources on disaster

  preparedness and response including information about the flexibilities built

  into OCS’ block grant programs. We recognize that when disasters hit, our grant

  recipients and partners need to be able to easily access guidance and resources

  as well as strategically utilize multiple funding streams to support both disaster

  response and relief and recovery efforts. The OCS Disaster Flexibilities Hub

  provides a one-stop shop for all the information you need to help you and your

  organization start to prepare for or respond to a disaster using OCS funding. LIVE
  WEATHER ACTIVITY The dashboard below shows live weather events and warnings around
  the country. Select your state and your county to view what the conditions are around
  you. This tool updates in real time. WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER The Office of Community
  Services has a

  nationwide presence. With thousands of grant recipients and administering

  agencies (agencies that provide direct services to individuals and families) all

  across the country, OCS grant recipients and their partners are particularly

  well equipped to assist during a disaster, and often times they work together

  to serve the same community. The map below provides a snapshot of SSBG grant

  recipients and CSBG, LIHEAP, and LIHWAP administering agencies across the

  country. You can use the locator tool below the map to identify all of the

  CSBG, LIHEAP, LIHWAP, and SSBG grant recipients and administering agencies in

  your community that you can collaborate with. Program Counts Sheet1 CSBG Program

  agencies count because they administer programs directly. 2. There are some administering
  agencies who provide CSBG, LIHEAP, and LIHWAP services. In these instances, the
  only one location is reflected on the map below (i.e., the teal dot). Click here
