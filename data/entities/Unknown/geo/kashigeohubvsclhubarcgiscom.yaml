  GEOSPATIAL DATA STORIES CHALLENGE 2022 By Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
  Geospatial technology is the future of enhanced service delivery in urban areas.
  It provides a common language to decipher the context of urban India and gain actionable
  insights by integrating all types of locational &amp; real time intelligence. To
  propel the urban geospatial ecosystem, Urban Geospatial Data Stories Challenge aims
  to combine the power of geospatial data, analytics, and open innovation. The Challenge
  is an opportunity for passionate individuals and ecosystem partners to co-create
  visionary narratives of future urban India. The innovative ideas and stories will
  help experience the potential of geospatial capabilities in cities and foster adoption
  of geospatial technologies. For more information visit URBAN GEOSPATIAL DATA STORIES
