  "Waiting lines for health care services" 2022-10-05. Opened Notice board of general
  education institutions. State Data Agency, aiming to better satisfy the need for
  statistical information, provides users with opportunities to access open data sets
  with data on statistical observation units. The anonymised records of data sets
  are prepared in such a way that the statistical unit cannot be identified, whether
  directly or indirectly. Open data set refers to data for which metadata description
  has been developed and the structure of which is clearly defined, and the data are
  prepared and made available in technologically open formats in accordance with the
  conditions of use applicable to the set. Open data sets are provided in a compressed
  (ZIP) folder. This folder contains data sets in CSV or Excel format, which is converted
  to SAS, SPSS or other format of package for statistical analysis. The survey methodologies
  are provided in PDF format. GIS data can be provided in two formats: Shapefile (SHP)
  or geographical database(GDB).

  Administrative source description is provided in DOCX format. GIS applications Open
  data sets are provided not only in the form of tables with download option. The
  data sets serve as a basis for development of various applications which not only
  provide access to the data but also allow interactive viewing and analysis thereof.
  The following are examples of the applications. Operational statistics COVID-19
  statistics War refugees from Ukraine Illegal migration Publications State Data Agency
  has been producing, compiling and providing statistical information throughout its
  entire lifetime. To make it easier to navigate between the multiple data, they were
  grouped and presented in printed publications. Modern society is not satisfied with
  this way of disseminating data. As a result, State Data Agency has moved to electronic
  publications, which increasingly integrate ArcGIS map narratives and dashboards
  thus enlivening publications, providing information in a visual and interactive
  way. The catalogue of electronic publications prepared by State Data Agency is available
  here. In order to get quick access to the key information in the publication, ArcGIS
  storytelling has been started, with a brief presentation of the specific publication.
  In addition to textual information, the story is often integrated with dashboards
  or other graphical elements. To access the publication itself, this can be done
  via the integrated link. GIS applications integrated into the Official Statistics
  Portal (OSP) The portal has 3 integrated interactive GIS applications where statistical
  information can be analysed in space and time. The first GIS application is integrated
  into the database analysis tool. A user is given the opportunity to create a map
  from the selected statistics (analytical map constructor). It is suggested to select
  the indicators of interest, year and territory. One indicator is displayed in the
  selected colours according to the selected interval number method and area on the
  map (choropleth map) ¬ the basis of the map. Other selected indicators are displayed
  in graphs. Indicator Database User Guide. The second, the interactive atlas GIS
  application, is designed to analyse statistics over time and space and compare them
  with each other. The application has a direct connection to the database, so in
  the interactive atlas, new data appears as soon as they are published in the database
  of indicators (DBI).  The application covers the following 3 areas: general statistics
  – indicators provided by official statistics are updated annually; censuses – only
  census data is displayed; gender equality statistics – demographic, socio-economic
  indicators are presented. The interactive statistical atlas provides statistics
  by region, county or municipality. Interactive atlas system help. The third application
  of detailed statistics is designed to display data at a more detailed level than
  administrative units. Currently, the application covers these 3 areas: population
  and housing census; agricultural census; operating economic entities. Data for all
  3 areas are presented in grids (100 m; 250 m; 500 m; 1 km; 2.5 km; 5 km; 10 km)
  and in administrative territories (settlement, eldership, municipality, county,
  region). Detailed statistical system help. GIS application integrated into the database

  Indicators (SDI) sharing portal Goals of sustainable development include global
  challenges related to social, economic and environmental issues. On the portal you
  will find descriptions of SDI goals and objectives, graphs, useful links. Open SDI
  data portal is also being developed. Follow us on social media! © State Data Agency.
