  \ Zero The City of Hoboken has a goal to achieve zero injuries and deaths caused\
  \ by crashes on our streets by 2030. The Hoboken Street Design Guide will help the\
  \ City reach this goal by ensuring that city streets are designed to safely and\
  \ efficiently accommodate our most vulnerable users, such as our oldest and youngest\
  \ residents, people with disabilities, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Project Partners\
