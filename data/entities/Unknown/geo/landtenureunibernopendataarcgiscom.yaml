  Mapping The third annual Participatory Mapping Symposium convened 117 participants
  from across 46 organizations, including members of civil society, NGOs and government.
  Hosted by OneMap Myanmar, Land Core Group and USAID Land Tenure Project, the two-day
  workshop engaged participants in active discussion about the value of bottom up
  participatory mapping approaches to address land issues in Myanmar. The symposium
  built upon previous participatory mapping symposiums and featured local organizations
  sharing their experiences of using mapping to engage local authorities and communities
  to raise land legal awareness and address community land-related concerns. The symposium
  identified next steps for strengthening a community of practice for participatory
  mapping and engaged participants in preliminary discussions about harmonizing mapping
  approaches in order to gain recognition and buy-in from Government. OneMap Myanmar
  presented a draft idea for a data sharing portal and resource website. Community
