  Story Map How well does a transit system serve commuters? Accessibility is the ease
  and feasibility of reaching valued destinations. It can be measured for a wide array
  of

  transportation modes, to different types of destinations, and at different times
  of day. There are a variety of ways to

  measure accessibility, but the number of destinations reachable within a given travel
  time is the most

  comprehensible and transparent as well as the most directly comparable across cities.
