description: 'Welcome to the Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO) Connecting People
  with Imagery APFO is now GEO Imagery and Geospatial Resources As of August 16, 2020
  APFO has transitioned to the USDA''s Farm Production and Conservation Business Center
  (FPAC-BC) Geospatial Enterprise Operations (GEO) Branch. GEO (APFO) is home to one
  of the country''s largest aerial film libraries.  We currently house more than 70,000
  rolls of film (10 million plus images).  Our film dates from 1955 to the present.  We
  have coverage of most of the United States and its territories. GEO (APFO) is in
  the process of scanning this film so that it can be accessible to GIS and remote
  sensing software programs.  Historic aerial images play a vital role today more
  than ever before with environmental assessments, change detection, and property
  boundary disputes.  Aerial Photography and digital orthophotography acquired by
  the USDA are in the public domain and are available to federal and state agencies,
  and to the general public through GEO (APFO). This Hub page provides access to selected
  geospatial data sets, maps, and web-based mapping applications that are published
  by GEO Salt Lake City (APFO). Visit these links for more information about FPAC-BC-GEO:
