  Report and track trail conditions, safety concerns, and maintenance issues to assist
  the NEK+ LVRT Regional Council in our work with Vermont AOT to create a safe and
  scenic experience for trail users. Create Account Submit Request Request Review
  Complete Work Create an account to submit and track the status of your requests.
  Submit requests to call out concerns on the Trail. Requests will automatically forward
  to AOT staff for review. Staff will complete work required to resolve the request.
  Submit A Conditions Report The process of reporting a conditions request on the
  LVRT has never been easier. Use the LVRT Conditions Reporter to view existing requests
  and submit new non-emergency requests for maintenance and other work along the Northeast
  Kingdom section of the  LVRT.  Emergency requests and illegal activities should
  always be directed to 911. Submit A Report Frequently Asked Questions Common questions
  you may be asking about the LVRT Conditions Reporter. Can I track the status of
  my service request? Do I have to create an account when I submit a service request?
  How do I provide feedback after the request has been completed? Does the LVRT Conditions
  Reporter handle emergency services? Yes, you can search for your request and check
  the status of your request at any time. If you create an account and login when
  you submit the request you can view 'My Submissions' in the LVRT Conditions Reporter
  app. No, you can remain anonymous when you submit a request. However, responsible
  agencies may want to follow up so providing contact information often ensures requests
  can be resolved more quickly. If you share your email address with us, we’ll send
  you a satisfaction survey after the work has been completed. No, the LVRT Conditions
  Reporter only handles non-emergency service requests.  Call 911 in the case of an
  emergency (burning house, accident, robbery, crime in progress, etc.) Service Request
  Data Authoritative data used to collect non-emergency service requests and track
  the status of each request. Maintenance Safety Hazards Other
