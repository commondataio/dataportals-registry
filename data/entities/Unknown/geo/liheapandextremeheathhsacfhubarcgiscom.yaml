description: 'How the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is helping
  people stay safe, healthy, and prepared to combat heat stress Purpose The U.S. Department
  of Health and Human Services'' (HHS), Administration for Children and Families''
  (ACF) Office of Community Services (OCS) recognize the importance of providing high-quality,
  accessible, and timely information for our partners and policy makers to help drive
  insights and seek better health and outcomes for all. This dashboard provides information
  on the progression of extreme heat over time, the health impacts of extreme heat,
  and visualizations on how the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)
  is able to alleviate extreme heat stress for vulnerable populations, including older
  adults, young children, and people with disabilities. On this site, you can explore
  data visualizations on extreme heat days over time, extreme health related hospitalizations,
  the impact LIHEAP has on reducing energy burden and more. What is Extreme Heat?
  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines extreme heat as summertime
  temperatures that are much hotter and/or humid than average. Because some places
  are hotter than others, this depends on what is considered average for a particular
  location and a particular time of year. Humid and muggy conditions can make it seem
  hotter than it really is. Heat continues to be the leading weather-related cause
  of death. According to the CDC, an average of approximately 700 deaths and 9,200
  hospitalizations occur each year due to extreme heat. Many of these heat related
  health incidents occurred within socially vulnerable and at-risk populations. According
  to a report released by CDC on July 16, 2021, the mean daily number of heat-related
  illness emergency department visits from June 25-30, 2021 in Region 10 was 69 times
  higher than that during the same days in 2019. The most affected groups were males
  and people age 75 and older. Region 10 includes Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.
  What is Heat Stress? Heat stress occurs when the body cannot get rid of excess

  heat. When this happens, the body''s core temperature rises and the heart rate

  increases. As the body continues to store heat, the person begins to lose

  concentration and has difficulty focusing on a task, may become irritable or

  sick, and often loses the desire to drink. The next stage is most often fainting

  and even death if the person is not cooled down. What is an Extreme Heat Event?
  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) defines an extreme heat event as
  a long period (2 to 3 days) of high heat and humidity with temperatures above 90
  degrees Fahrenheit. The increase in frequency and time of these heat events is a
  major cause for concern as extreme heat is expected to continue threatening the
  wellbeing of families and vulnerable populations. Extreme heat-related deaths significantly
  outnumber those caused by any other weather-related disaster. Low-income households
  are more likely to suffer from extreme heat and other natural disasters, creating
  financial and health concerns that impact individuals'' and families'' wellbeing.
  Historic Temperature Trends Map Instructions: This map automatically moves through
  the years between 1979-2019. To pause the map, select the pause/play button in the
  upper left-hand corner of the dashboard. To change the year displayed on the map,
  select a year from the dropdown menu to the right of the pause/play button. To further
  explore the map, you can select  +/- in the top left corner to zoom in or out. Select
  the ''about data'' box in the top right to view the additional data details, and
  hover your mouse over areas on the map to view the number of days above 90 degrees
  Fahrenheit. Map Details: This map of U.S. counties represents the historical temperature
  and heat index with the count (number) of extreme heat days (days above 90 degrees
  Fahrenheit) from 1979 - 2019. Counties in dark red experienced  the greatest increase
  in the number of extreme heat days, as compared to counties in light red. Regional
  trends in extreme heat days are apparent in the map. In particular, the Southern
  Great Plains and Southeast regions of the U.S. have experienced the greatest increases
  in the number of extreme heat days over the 40-year period, as have some areas of
  the Southwest, Northeast, and Midwest regions. Many of the states in the Western
  U.S., as well as those in the Northern Great Plains, region have not experienced
  significant changes in extreme heat days. Time series map by Centers for Disease
  Control and Prevention (CDC) Stay Cool with LIHEAP Changes to our climate mean that
  our communities need to prepare for the health risks of higher temperatures. The
  videos below provide information on how LIHEAP can help families be prepared during
  extreme heat and the impacts of climate change. LIHEAP Cooling Assistance Program
  Summer can mean dangerously high heat for many people. It can also mean households
  have to make the difficult choice between paying for home cooling or paying for
  family essentials, such as food or medical care. Watch this video to learn how the
  Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) can help you pay your energy
  bills and keep cool and safe this summer. Washington State The Washington spotlight
  video highlights how the state has used LIHEAP funds, including ARP funds, to implement
  a cooling assistance program to help mitigate the impact of extreme heat. The program
  provides LIHEAP-eligible households with air conditioning units and hardship benefits
  to help pay for the electricity needed to run the units. Extreme Heat and Health
  Extreme heat can cause a variety of health issues from heat stroke, to cardiovascular
  disease and even death. Organizations and government entities focusing on public
  health and safety have outlined strategies aimed at protecting the public from high
  temperatures. The use of cooling centers, a cool site, or airconditioned building
  designated as a safe location during extreme heat is a common strategy. Dashboard
  Instructions: To select a state to explore, use the ''pick a state'' selector on
  the left side of the page. To return to the national view, select that same state
  again. To select a year to explore, use the ''pick a year'' selector on the top
  right of the dashboard. Dashboard Details: The dashboard below includes information
  from the CDC from 2016-2021 on extreme heat related deaths, emergency room visits,
  and hospitalizations. The dashboard includes both national and state level data. The
  HHS is in the process of updating this data set, once complete this tool will be
  updated to include that information. For more details on how the CDC gathered this
  data, please visit  https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/tracking/about.htm Explore Additional
