  small tributaries but also from other sources. In fact, 49% of all flood claims
  come OUTSIDE the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). Even though flash flood events
  in North Texas are most common during the months of May and June, the potential
  for flooding is present throughout the year and can affect nearly every person in
  Highland Village. To find more information about flood hazard in Highland Village
