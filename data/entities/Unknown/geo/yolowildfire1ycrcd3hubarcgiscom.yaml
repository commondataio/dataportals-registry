description: "Living with Wildfire Yolo County coming together to build fire safe\
  \ communities. Welcome! This site is currently being used inform residents about\
  \ the Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP) for Yolo County. The plan was adopted\
  \ in April 2023 (see link below) and will be updated roughly every five years. \
  \ However, we continue to gather valuable input from the communities in the high\
  \ fire zones.  Please help us by providing feedback on our Community Base Map and\
  \ informing us of assets and values at risk from wildfire in your community. This\
  \ project is being done by the Yolo County Resource Conservation District (YCRCD)\
  \ and the Yolo County Office of Emergency Services (OES). We are gathering your\
  \ input in several ways: Achieving our Goals The Yolo County Resource Conservation\
  \ District (YCRCD) and the Yolo County Office of Emergency Services (OES) have formed\
  \ a county-wide Fire Safe Council (YCFSC), and completed a Community Wildfire Protection\
  \ Plan (CWPP). The YCFSC is committed to increasing wildfire awareness in the county,\
  \ supporting community fire safe councils and developing projects that will create\
  \ more fire-resilient communities. Please see our new website at: yolofiresafe.org\
  \ Form A Fire Safe Council-Done! Support the Formation of Community FSCs Complete\
  \ a CWPP-Done! Approve the CWPP-Done! Start the Action Plan-A work in progress which\
  \ depends on funding The Yolo County Fire Safe council is composed of diverse stakeholders\
  \ and coordinated by the YCRCD. YCFSC stakeholders will contribute to the CWPP.\
  \ The YCFSC is working to support community FSCs, which are grassroots, citizen-led\
  \ groups.  New fire safe councils in the County are: the Capay Valley Fire Protection\
  \ District FSC and the West Winters FSC. This process requires 1) collaboration;\
  \ 2) prioritized fuel reduction; and 3) treatment of structural ignitability.  A\
  \ CWPP must recommend measures that homeowners and communities can take to reduce\
  \ ignitability. The Yolo County CWPP was approved and signed by local government\
  \ (The Yolo County Board of Supervisors), local fire authorities (The Yolo County\
  \ Fire Chiefs) and CALFIRE (The Sonoma Lake Napa Unit Chief). Having a county CWPP\
  \ in place opens up funding opportunities for vegetation management, chipping programs\
  \ and other fuel reduction projects. Interested in participating in our Yolo County\
  \ Fire Safe Council meetings? You can find out more about our upcoming meetings\
  \ on our new website: www.yolofiresafe.org and the Yolo County Fire Safe Council\
  \ Facebook page. Or if you'd rather be notified by email, please enter your email\
  \ address in the form to the right. We won't share your email address with anyone\
  \ and we'll only use your email to let you know of upcoming CWPP or wildfire planning\
  \ related events. Thanks! Primary Focus Areas Our Yolo County Community Wildfire\
  \ Protection Plan will cover the entire county of Yolo.  Western Yolo County includes\
  \ the CALFIRE State Responsibility Area (SRA), small sections of Federal Responsibility\
  \ Area (FRA) and the communities at risk: Rumsey, Guinda, Brooks, Capay, Esparto\
  \ and Winters, and a High Hazard Zone that includes the community of Dunnigan. Capay\
  \ Valley Since 2018, wildfire has burned the western edge of the Capay Valley, threatening\
  \ the communities of Rumsey, Guinda, Brooks and Capay. For the Capay Valley Emergency\
  \ Response Auxiliary Face Book and Fire Safe Council page:\n    Click Here Western\
  \ Winters The landscape west of Winters has the highest \"fire return interval\"\
  \ in the state, burning six out of seven years, from 2013-2020.  There is a \"Greater\
  \ Winters Community Wildfire Protection Plan\" which has been included in the Yolo\
  \ County CWPP. Area Map Frequently Asked Questions Below we provide some answers\
  \ to potential questions you may have regarding CWPPs. At the end, we offer the\
  \ opportunity to submit your own question. What is a Community Wildfire Protection\
  \ Plan (CWPP)? How does the CWPP address California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)?\
  \ A CWPP is a community-based plan focused on identifying and addressing local hazards\
  \ and risks from wildfire. A CWPP determines what is at risk and provides a roadmap\
  \ of actions for a community to address the wildfire threat. A CWPP may open up\
  \ federal funding opportunities to implement the plan. Defined in the United States\
  \ Congress Healthy Forests Restoration Act (2003), the goal of the CWPP is to enhance\
  \ efforts to protect communities, watersheds and other at-risk lands from catastrophic\
  \ wildfire. A CWPP is not a regulatory document, but provides wildfire hazard and\
  \ risk assessments, community descriptions, options for addressing issues of structural\
  \ vulnerability to wildfire (Home Hardening), and provides a prioritized list of\
  \ projects which, if implemented, can serve to reduce wildfire hazards. A CWPP is\
  \ one of the best tools we have to take strides to adapt our county to a wildfire-prone\
  \ environment. The CWPP will contain hazard and risk analyses and, using a collaborative\
  \ model, will suggest projects that can efficiently  reduce risk of loss of life,\
  \ property loss, and environmental damage. What is required in a CWPP? A CWPP can\
  \ vary in scope, scale, and detail, but must meet three minimum requirements for\
  \ their contents and adoption per the Healthy Forest Restoration Act and the State\
  \ of California. These requirements include: The CWPP itself is not a project under\
  \ California Environmental Quality Act. Instead, the CWPP will serve to guide the\
  \ preparation of specific action\ndecisions which may require CEQA analysis. Why\
  \ did Yolo County create a CWPP? How was the development of the CWPP funded? How\
  \ will the actions identified in the CWPP be implemented? The collaborative process\
  \ of a CWPP allowed partners to participate in planning and prioritizing wildfire\
  \ wildfire risk reduction projects. Partners include, but by no means limited to:\
  \ Collaborative planning helps the County adapt to wildfire by: The CWPP process\
  \ provides opportunities to share science-based assessments &amp; GIS modeling with\
  \ the community  to increase understanding of wildfire hazards and risks across\
  \ landscapes and communities. It also provides opportunities for a variety of partners\
  \ to share views, define their own communities’ assets and values, and let their\
  \ concerns be known. Having risk-reduction projects listed and prioritized in a\
  \ CWPP can add weight to grant proposals, and help link projects to potential funders.\
  \ In 2020, the Yolo County RCD received a funding from CAL FIRE and the California\
  \ Climate Investment Program to create the county-wide CWPP. Following approval\
  \ of the CWPP, Yolo County RCD staff began applying for project funding. When funding\
  \ is received, we can proceed with preparing Implementation Plans. The Implementation\
  \ Plans should identify the specific actions and steps needed to implement those\
  \ actions. Any actions that require site specific treatments to address wildfire\
  \ hazard may require environmental review under the California Environmental Quality\
  \ Act and permitting. Submit your own question Feel free to email us directly to\
  \ submit any question you may have regarding CWPPs or this CWPP process. We look\
  \ forward to hearing from you!"
