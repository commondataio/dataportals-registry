  Dates 2011 NAIP Image Dates The NAIP Image date files are available for years 2011
  - 2022.  The image date vector files were an enhancement that came later in the
  history of NAIP so they were not a contract deliverable before 2011.  Please note: 
  Image date information for years 2011-2013 do not include the RGBNIR field information
  as this was also a later enhancement. 2022 States that are not available on the
  hub have either not been delivered yet or we are waiting for corrected files and
  the remaining states will be uploaded as soon as possible after the corrected files
  are received.
