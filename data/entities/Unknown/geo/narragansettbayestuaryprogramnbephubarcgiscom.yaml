description: 'We synthesize data on environmental conditions and trends to inform
  management and research focused on restoring and protecting water quality, wildlife,
  and quality of life in the Narragansett Bay region. Welcome to our data hub! Find
  Data All data shared on this site are publicly available for your use in new applications,
  maps, and analysis. Boundaries Water Ecosystems People Landscape Climate Change
  Data are available in several formats: Vector and raster datasets can be downloaded
  individually OR in full geodatabases containing all datasets (spatial and tabular)
  for each indicator. Excel spreadsheets (1) summarize spatial conditions and trends at
  a range of scales (e.g., by town, HUC12, or bay section), or (2) provide the raw
  data behind the non-spatial analyses in the 2017 Technical Report. Many Excel table
  results can be filtered for your area of interest (e.g., the percent impervious
  cover in a subwatershed). Raw data tables for each shapefile can be downloaded in
  the "Data" tab, which will provide the data associated with each spatial feature
  (e.g., a segment of the bay or stream segment). Map Gallery'
