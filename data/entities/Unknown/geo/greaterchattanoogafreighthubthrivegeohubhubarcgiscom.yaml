  Infrastructure Portal! This data gateway was created by Thrive Regional Partnership''s
  Freight Mobility Coalition, a cross-sector network that holds industry-related conversations
  across county and state boundaries in the tri-state greater Chattanooga region.
  The Coalition identified a need for easily accessible datasets unique to the greater
  Chattanooga region, situated in a bustling logistics corridor in the corner of Alabama,
  Georgia, and Tennessee. Built by Thrive Regional Partnership and Georgia Tech, this
  is your gateway to learn more about freight industry, logistics data, and transportation
  infrastructure in the tri-state greater Chattanooga region. Use the links below
