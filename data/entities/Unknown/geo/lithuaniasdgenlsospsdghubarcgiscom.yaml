  universal peace in larger freedom. We recognize that eradicating poverty in all
  its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge
  and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development“. The Agenda establishes
  17 goals and 169 targets. Goals are based on three sustainable development aspects
  (environmental, social and economic), covering the domains of poverty, inequality,
  food safety, health, sustainable consumption and production, employment, infrastructure,
  sustainable management of natural resources, actions to fight climate change, gender
  equality, peaceful and inclusive society, etc. The list of sustainable development
  indicators includes more than 200 indicators to achieve them. The 70th Session of
