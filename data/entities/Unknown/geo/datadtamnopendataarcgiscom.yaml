description: Duluth Transit Authority Open Data Making Minnesota's Transit Data Transparent
  This is the Duluth Transit Authority's public platform for sharing information,
  downloading open data, and engaging with the community to solve important local
  issues. Users can analyze and combine Open Datasets using maps, as well as develop
  new web and mobile applications. Let's work to make our transit system even better,
  together! DTA Project Updates DTA Bus Stop Removal Project The DTA is undergoing
  an extensive evaluation of bus stops throughout Duluth and Superior. The goal of
  the bus stop project is to identify areas where bus stops can be consolidated to
  improve bus travel times. There are a lot of variables that go into the placement
  of bus stops and the reasons behind removals. Check out the Bus Stop Project page
  for updates about what bus stops are being removed and information on bus stops
  standards. Miller Hill Mall ADA Construction Projects The DTA has applied for funding
  to complete four construction projects in the Miller Hill Mall area that will improve
  accessibility to bus stops and improve routing of the mall area buses. Expansion
  Route Progress In August of 2017, the DTA launched four new routes and in December
  of 2017 we launched a fifth one to United Healthcare. These routes were part of
  a MnDOT Office of Transit expansion grant and the funding is provided for a pilot
  period of two years. The DTA will be monitoring the progress of the routes and at
  the end of the two year period the routing will be brought under review. Explore
