  Outcomes SCCFSC is managing the project to update the county’s Community Wildfire
  Protection Plan (CWPP) with support from partners including CAL FIRE, Santa Clara
  County Fire, County of Santa Clara Office of Emergency Management, and others. CAL
  FIRE has awarded a $250,000 grant to SCCFSC to lead the 2022-2023 CWPP update. With
  this grant, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) has been selected to update the
  current CWPP (drafted in 2016) in coordination with regional stakeholders. SWCA
  also worked on the 2016 CWPP led by the Santa Clara County Fire Department (SCCFD).
  The CWPP update will build on the current CWPP and will cover the entire county
  with a focus on the wildland urban interface (WUI)*. The planning process is expected
  to go through August 2023. The Community Wildfire Protection Plan (CWPP) project
  grant is part of California Climate Investments, a statewide initiative that puts
  billions of Cap-and-Trade dollars to work reducing greenhouse gas emissions, strengthening
  the economy, and improving public health and the environment — particularly in disadvantaged
  communities. By having this strategic plan for all the local agencies they are able
  to prioritize forest health projects, shaded fuel breaks, escape routes, and public
  education campaigns. The CWPP will further wildfire preparedness initiatives throughout
  the county, and provide support for residents seeking resources to be better prepared
  for wildfire. *The (WUI) Wildland Urban Interface is the area where human development
  meets undeveloped wildland or vegetative fuels.
