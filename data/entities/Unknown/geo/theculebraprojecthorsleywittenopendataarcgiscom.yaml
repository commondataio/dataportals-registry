description: 'Monitoring. Evaluation. Management Action. Habitat Protection. Towards
  Meaningful Habitat Conservation The lush region of the Culebra Island archipelago
  has seen significant declines in the quality and extent of mangroves, coral reefs,
  and seagrass beds due to unsustainable coastal development, over-zealous recreation,
  land-based sources of pollution, and the effects of climate change such as rising
  sea surface temperatures. We can work together to support the vibrant Culebra community
  and to achieve long-term recovery of marine resources and coastal habitat. Use this
  platform to track our progress toward habitat conservation, discover conservation
  resources, explore and download data, and engage with our community of practitioners
  to help make the greatest impact for Culebra. NOAA is working with partners and
  communities to implement a variety of management actions that address two of the
  most critical local stressors: sewage and sediment. Our goal is to evaluate the
  success of those efforts towards the sustained recovery of nearshore coastal ecosystems.

  of marine resources and coastal areas. Join our conservation efforts. Browse and
