description: 'Latest Updates A new toolkit for assessing the policy trade-offs when
  investing in climate-resilient infrastructure An orderly transition to a lower-carbon
  economy will be the least costly policy stance in every region Preservation of forests
  in developing economies critical to stay within carbon budget Featured Indicators
  The scope and capacity of the Climate Change Indicators Dashboard is highlighted
  below. Here you’ll find example indicators from each of the four economic categories,
  with data driven visualizations showing how global economic activity is affecting
  the climate and what governments are doing to mitigate these impacts. Global GHG
  Emissions Increased by 1.8 Percent in 2022, Despite a 0.4 Percent Decrease in The
  Fourth Quarter of That Year Millions of metric tons of CO2 equivalent - Seasonally
  adjusted Despite a 0.4 percent decrease in global greenhouse gas emissions during
  the fourth quarter of 2022, the overall trend for the year showed an increase of
  1.8 percent. Among the region, Europe made the largest quarterly contribution with
  a decrease of 1.9 percent. Asia experienced the highest annual emissions increase
  at 2.8 percent. According to the latest UNFCCC reports the best estimate of temperature
  change is 2.5-2.9°C and there is an agreement that net zero CO2 emissions are the
  prerequisite for halting warming at any level. It will be necessary to closely monitor
  the emissions to ascertain whether or not the countries can build further on the
  clean energy momentum towards significant overachievement of the latest NDCs, helping
  to attain emission levels suggested for keeping warming likely below 2°C. Advanced
  Economies maintain Comparative Advantage in Exports of Low Carbon Technology Products
  Values for 2021 This map shows that advanced economies maintained their comparative
  advantage in exporting Low Carbon Technology (LCT) products in 2021. Low-carbon
  technology products are products that feature technology adapted to a low-carbon
  economy, specifically technology that reduces greenhouse gas emissions. These include
  wind turbines, solar panels, and carbon capture equipment.A value greater than one
  (&gt;1) indicates a relative advantage in exports of low carbon technology products,
  while a value of less than or equal to one (≤1) indicates a relative disadvantage.

  of Bank Loans Varies Significantly Across Countries Tons CO2 /Million $US Transition
  towards a low carbon economy brings along risks to the financial industry. Banks
  provide loans in response to the funding needs of various sectors. The Carbon Footprint
  of Bank Loans (CFBL) captures the exposure of banks to transition risk in a cross-country
  comparable way. The CFBL is a country-level indicator, constructed as the average
  of CO2 emission intensities/multipliers from the fuels burned in each sector, weighted
  by the sectoral share of outstanding domestic loans from banks. This graph depicts
  the carbon footprint of bank loans around the world. The higher the ratio, the greater
  the carbon intensity of banks’ domestic loans portfolio. Environmental Taxes as
  a Share of GDP Averaged 1.7% in 2020 Environmental taxes as a share of GDP averaged
  1.7% of GDP across reporting countries in 2020, in part due to the decline in revenues
  from gasoline taxes because of lockdowns in response to Covid 19. This is slightly
  down from the high reached in 2005, when environmental taxes as a share of GDP sat
  at 1.8%. Environmental taxes are divided into four types: (1) Taxes on energy, including
  fuel for transport; (2) taxes on transport, excluding fuel for transport; (3) taxes
  on pollution; and (4) taxes on resources.An environmental tax is a charge levied
  on a physical unit of an item that has a proven negative impact on the environment.
  A gallon of petrol, a passenger flight or a ton of waste bound for landfill are
  examples of such physical units. Environmental Taxes show how governments around
  the world are responding to climate change through taxation. Percent of GDP Environmental
  taxes as a share of GDP averaged 1.7% of GDP across reporting countries in 2020,

  flight or a ton of waste bound for landfill are examples of such physical units.
  Environmental Taxes show how governments around the world are responding to climate
  change through taxation. In collaboration with other international organizations,
  the IMF has identified and developed a range of distinctive indicators that demonstrate
  the impact economic activity is having on climate change. These indicators have
  been grouped into five categories: Economic Activity, Cross-Border, Financial and
  Risks, Government Policy, and Climate Change Data. We''re looking for your feedback.'
