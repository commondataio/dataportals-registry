description: 'DATCP GIS Data DATCP provides this site as the location to host its
  commonly requested, statewide GIS data for download. DATCP GIS data is provided
  on an “as is” basis. Users are responsible for determining “fitness of use” of DATCP
  GIS data for their particular purposes. DATCP updates its GIS data regularly, and
  users are responsible for checking and downloading updated DATCP GIS data files,
  as needed, to support their business needs. DATCP GIS data is spatially referenced
  to the WTM83, NAD83 (1991) coordinate system. DATCP provides its GIS data in ArcGIS
  file geodatabase (version 10.3+) or shapefile format. GIS data is grouped into file
  geodatabases or folders by “theme” (e.g, nutrient management), and folders and file
  geodatabases are then “zipped” to facilitate data transfer. Explore your data CAFO

  on the 1991 adjustment to the North American Datum of 1983 – WTM83, NAD83 (1991)
  for short– and provides its GIS data in this system. DATCP staff is not available
  for coordinate system conversions as part of GIS data downloads or requests. DATCP
  Data Format: DATCP provides vector data (point, line or polygon data) in ArcGIS
  file geodatabase (version 10.2 +) format. DATCP staff may be available to convert
  agency GIS data to ArcGIS shapefile format upon request. DATCP Legal Notice: DATCP
  provides its GIS data on an “as is” basis. Users are responsible for determining
  the “fitness of use” of DATCP GIS data for their particular purposes. In addition,
  DATCP updates its GIS data periodically. It is the responsibility of users to check
  for and download updated DATCP GIS data files, as needed. Please note that DATCP
  does not re-distribute GIS data that it acquires from other sources. Requesters
