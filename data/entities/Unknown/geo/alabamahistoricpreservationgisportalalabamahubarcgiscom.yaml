description: 'Alabama Historic Preservation GIS Portal Alabama''s Interactive and
  Downloadable Preservation Portal to the Past Welcome

  to the Alabama Historical Commission’s Historic

  Preservation GIS Portal! The

  mission at AHC is to Protect, Preserve, and Interpret Alabama’s Historic Places. In

  keeping with our mission, this website and the maps and open data associated

  with it is designed to be an important

  tool in the preservation, research, and understanding of

  Alabama’s historic places for future

  generations. We hope this will encourage all

  those who visit the site to become more aware of their heritage and to

  recognize the importance of preserving it. The Alabama Legislature

  established the Alabama Historical Commission (AHC) in 1966 to foster the

  understanding and preservation of Alabama’s heritage. Through an number of programs,
  the AHC has collected valuable information on Alabama’s man-made

  environment including historic houses, churches, schools, bridges, cemeteries,

  commercial buildings, farms, etc. These files include paper survey forms;

  photographs (i.e. prints, contact sheets, slides

  and negatives); maps; measured drawings; blueprints; and accompanying

  materials. While AHC has made great strides

  to maintain and organize these paper files which previously were accessible by visiting

  the AHC’s main office, these documents are unique and for most there

  are no other backups and therefore are irreplaceable, which is the reason the AHC
  has been diligently working to convert these paper

  files associated with Alabama’s historic architectural and historic resources into
  a web-based system utilizing Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to improve public
  accessibility to this information and to ensure the long-term preservation of these
  vital records. Geographic Information System

  (GIS) is a framework for gathering, managing, and analyzing data that is rooted

  in the science of geography. The ability to have easily accessible historic

  resource locations within a GIS is an invaluable and important tool for those

  interested in Alabama’s built environment. The AHC’s Alabama Historic Preservation
  Map Initiative project consists of

  digitizing and constructing a GIS database for AHC''s Historic Preservation

  Division Programs. The Alabama Historic Preservation Map Initiative will enable

  the public to explore these resources virtually and understand why these

  resources are culturally important to Alabama, particularly in the communities

  in which they exist. Our GIS map includes maps for all

  the AHC''s historic preservation programs. Listed
