description: "THE SDG TUNISIA HUB \n    SUPPORTS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF\n    TUNISIA'S\
  \ SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, \n    PEOPLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL \n    GOALS BY 2030. ABOUT US\
  \ Welcome to Tunisia’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) data hub. The hub helps\
  \ monitor progress on the Sustainable Development Goals, promotes exploration, analysis,\
  \ and collaboration using authoritative SDG data sources for evidence-based decision-making\
  \ and advocacy. Our goal is to enable data providers, managers and users to discover,\
  \ understand, and communicate patterns and interrelationships, and enable decision\
  \ makers to identify needs and establish collaborations to advance toward the equitable\
  \ achievement of the SDGs in Tunisia. In this section, you are able to view Tunisia’s\
  \ data per Sustainable Development Goal. Set by the United Nations in 2015, the\
  \ Sustainable Development Goals provide a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity\
  \ for people and the planet, now and into the future. The SDGs are an urgent call\
  \ for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership.\
  \ SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities Before the pandemic hit, modest gains had been made\
  \ in reducing inequality in some areas, for instance, reducing income inequality\
  \ in some countries, continuing preferential trade status to lower-income countries,\
  \ and reducing transaction costs of remittances. However, inequality persists in\
  \ its various forms, whether income, wealth, opportunities or other dimensions.\
  \ The COVID-19 pandemic is now exacerbating existing inequalities within and among\
  \ countries and hitting the most vulnerable people and the poorest countries hardest\
  \ and is projected to push back the poorest countries a full 10 years on their SDG\
  \ progress. Globally, refugees were at the highest absolute number on record in\
  \ 2020. Even amidst strict COVID-19 mobility restrictions across the globe, thousands\
  \ of migrants died along the migratory journey. Explore the data Follow Tunisia's\
  \ progress on the Sustainable Development Goals. The data can be downloaded in various\
  \ formats and explored on an interactive map. Community Action If you are interested\
  \ in learning more about the SDG Data Hub, leave us your information and a brief\
  \ description and we will get back to you. Achieving the SDGs for all communities\
  \ in Tunisia requires everyone’s actions. Engage with the work of Tunisia’s Government\
  \ and its private, multilateral and non-governmental partners to participate in\
  \ the achievement of long-term and sustainable outcomes, processes, relationships,\
  \ and decisions that affect your community!"
