description: 'to Restore, Connect, and Protect The Green Infrastructure Plan is a
  set of maps and strategies for South Carolina to conserve its highest value landscapes
  for both wildlife and people. The South Carolina Forestry Commission (SCFC) and
  the nonprofit Green Infrastructure Center, Inc. (GIC) collaborated with state, regional,
  and local governments, and federal and state agencies to create a strategic green
  infrastructure network and plan for South Carolina. Green Infrastructure (GI) includes
  all the interconnected natural systems in a landscape such as intact forests, wetlands,
  bays, dune systems, rivers, and agricultural soils that provide clean water, air
  quality, wildlife habitat, and food. Planning to conserve or restore GI ensures
  that communities can be vibrant, healthful, and resilient. Having clean air and
  water, nature-based recreation, scenic viewsheds, abundant local food and sustainable
  working lands requires that environmental assets are included as part of community
  planning. The effort to map the highest value landscapes in

  South Carolina was built from the ground up, region by region to

  result in a statewide priority network of vital conservation lands and

  corridors. GIC and SCFC worked with South Carolina’s ten Councils

  of Government (COGs) to set regional priorities. Each COG serves as the regional

  coordinating body for its member counties and cities to plan for transportation

  or trails, such as the East Coast Blueway or the Palmetto Trail. COGs can serve

  a similar role in planning for a connected green infrastructure network to

  foster a healthier forest landscape for both wildlife and people. The effort to

  Map GIC followed regional-level workshops with planners and stakeholders at the
  COG, county, and city level with state-level stakeholder engagement. In December
  2022 and January 2023 representatives from 16 state agencies and non-profit organizations
  gathered to focus on state-level strategies for protecting and restoring green infrastructure.

  Additional Resources GIC has written numerous books, guides, and case studies on
  how to plan and implement

  green infrastructure strategies for South Carolina’s communities.

  There are numerous free tools and other resources available through SCFC
