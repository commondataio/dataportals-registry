description: 'Critical Infrastructure Directorate Welcome to the Canadian Infrastructure
  Data Sharing Hub. This resource was developed by Public Safety Canada''s Critical
  Infrastructure Directorate to support access to data that supports critical infrastructure
  stakeholders. Canadian Infrastructure Data Sharing Hub is intended to assist users
  to find relevant maps, apps and data that support their usage of critical infrastructure
  data. Data hub features: For this initial CID test and going forward, we appreciate
  your thoughts and feedback as those inputs, concerns and ideas will help guide our
  continued improvements to the user experience. For support, assistance or to provide
  feedback please contact us at ps.vrac-cavr.sp@ps-sp.gc.ca For more information on

  Critical Infrastructure Information sharing. CI Data Explorer Use the CID Data Explorer
  App in Fullscreen The Critical Infrastructure Data Explorer is intended to help
  quickly preview and view the available layers by sector. Chose a sector from the
  menu on the left to view previews of its layers on the right. To view an individual
  layer in the central map select its thumbnail preview on the right. Infrastructure
  Layers Use the  Infrastructure Data Layers App in fullscreen The Critical Infrastructure
  Data Layers App allows users to choose the layers to view and combine across multiple
  sectors. The three icons on the left bar allow you to choose to view the legend
  (dots and dashes), select layer (stacked sheets) or view attributes by selecting
  a specific feature on the map (text bubble) in the left panel. Use the layer select
  view to select and display one or more data layers: Below are stylized sector-based
  links that search by data tags, I''ve left these here as samples styles that we
  could use to link and display content. Right now, they search this hub site only
  but could be configured to pull up sector maps or data searches beyond the hub into
  the ESRI Living Atlas produced by ESRI and its users. Explore Infrastructure Data
