description: Strategic Planning Location Intelligence Hub This site provides access
  to a collection of web-based spatial data and location intelligence applications
  that relate either to specific work areas within the Strategic Planning Group, or
  to subjects that have a wider strategic relevance to the group's varied interests.
  The applications featured here range from simple interactive maps that display location-based
  information in a clear and straightforward way, through to more complex spatially-enabled
  dashboards that allow for the interrogation of the underlying data via the use of
  selections and filters, and the visualisation of outputs using a variety of data
  display metrics. Popular Applications
