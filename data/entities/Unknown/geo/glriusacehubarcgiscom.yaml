description: Great Lakes Restoration Initiative The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative
  accelerates efforts to protect and restore the largest system of fresh surface water
  in the world – the Great Lakes. Built upon the foundation of the Great Lakes Regional
  Collaboration Strategy, GLRI answered a challenge of the governors of the Great
  Lakes states. Under this initiative, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
  in partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and
  United States Department of the Interior Geological Survey (USGS) are developing
  Sediment Budgets and Lakeshore Geomorphic Vulnerability Index for the Upper Great
  Lakes. Sediment Budgets for the Lower Great Lakes have since been completed, and
  are publicly accessible here. Learn More about the Great Lakes Sediment Budget DISCOVER
  Interactive dashboard maps allow you to visualize the data collected during the
  Sediment Budget and Lakeshore  Geomorphic Vulnerability Index development processes.
  View the shoreline of the Upper Great Lakes (with vegetation removed) in 3D using
  the digital elevation model. Visualize the shoreline of the Upper Great Lakes as
  it was in 1970-1980 using the georeferenced historic imagery. See the Upper Great
  Lakes from a low flying aircraft using the 2012 oblique photographs. And much more!
  LEARN Dashboard maps walk you through the project development process. Need more
