description: 'Valley Management The LIFE Integrated Project is an eight-year project
  led by the Energy and Water Agency and co-financed under the EU LIFE Programme,
  which aims to support the implementation of the Water Framework Directive in Malta.
  This project will help towards the better management of all water resources in the
  Maltese Islands. The Valley Management Unit within Project Green is responsible
  for meeting the requirements of Action A8: Catchment Modelling under the LIFE Integrated
  Project and Action C9: Pilot Projects. The team is made up of a Principal Scientific
  Officer, GIS Manager, Research Manager, Ecologist, Geologist and Hydrologist. Through
  the cards below and tabs above, you can view and query the information we have gathered
  through the LIFE IP MT 008 project Actions A8 and C9. The data collected in the
  field can be seen in our WebGIS below, along with our methodology and more detailed
  information on our study areas. The tabs above lead you to more information about
  our project, our research on ecosystem services, the way forward in terms of activities
  and research, and all the data that is freely downloadable from our Downloads &amp;
  Contacts tab. A detailed survey methodology was set up to collect scientific data
  needed for effective management and planning of interventions in Maltese valleys.
  Around 80km of watercourse within sixteen catchments, including the four largest
  catchments (GÄ§asel, Kbir, Xlendi and Dwejra) were included within our study.A 50m
  buffer was mapped on either side of the stream network as the boundary for the detailed
  study area. The resulting area of circa 10km2 was surveyed intensively.More than
  25,000 geographic objects were collected during the fieldwork, divided into 16 feature
  classes with more than 100 attribute fields.We invite you to explore the data using
  our interactive map. All the datasets presented are available for free download
  from our Downloads &amp; Contacts section. Contact Informationvalleymanagement.lifeip@gov.mt
