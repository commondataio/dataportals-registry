description: "Open Data Welcome to National Trust Open Data.  We have set up this\
  \ website to share spatial datasets related to National Trust land, as well as of\
  \ the coastline of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, as part of the Mapping Our\
  \ Shores project.\n\n\nOur spatial datasets can be downloaded and used in external\
  \ software, such as a GIS (Geographical Information System).  To explore the National\
  \ Trust data, there's the 'Always Open' and 'Limited Access' land layers - as displayed\
  \ on the Ordnance Survey (OS) maps.  Please refer to the story-map further down\
  \ the page that helps explain the data and how it can be used.  To explore the Mapping\
  \ Our Shores coastal data, you can download the 1965 and 2014 land use data, as\
  \ well as gain access to the original 1965 scanned OS maps, complete with annotations.\
  \ National Trust land datasets Always open Limited access This layer shows the approximately\
  \ 114,000 hectares of National Trust land that the public has access to on foot\
  \ only (last updated: May 2017) – either by right (in the case of designated ‘Access\
  \ Land’ under the Countryside (Rights of Way) Act 2000 (CRoW)) or by permission\
  \ from the National Trust. Rights over Access Land are limited by CRoW and may be\
  \ further restricted or excluded due to particular land management reasons. This\
  \ layer shows the approximately 19,300 hectares of National Trust land where the\
  \ public has limited access (last updated: May 2017).  This data shows areas where\
  \ access is restricted for at least one of the following reasons:\n\n1. The land\
  \ is enclosed as part of a National Trust Estate.\n2. Access is restricted to a\
  \ dense path network.\n3. There are specific reasons the land is not Always Open\
  \ e.g. Safety concerns. Data available for England &amp; Wales. Work is in progress\
  \ for creating equivalent data for Northern Ireland. Understanding the data The\
  \ National Trust looks after nearly 250,000 hectares of land in England, Wales and\
  \ Northern Ireland. Large areas of this land is open to the public free of charge,\
  \ and other areas are ticketed – open to National Trust members and paying members\
  \ of the public.\n\n\nAdditional areas of National Trust land are used for farming,\
  \ or other commercial activities, and the public doesn’t have any right to access\
  \ this land, other than by statutory provision e.g. footpaths and bridleways.\n\n\
  \nTo help you explore and understand the data, we’ve created this story-map. Scroll\
  \ through the text to read more about the ‘Always Open’ and ‘Limited Access’ data\
  \ layers, and to see specific examples of this type of land on the map. As you read,\
  \ the map will change to illustrate what we’re explaining. Mapping our shores In\
  \ 1965, concerned about the impact of development along the coast, the National\
  \ Trust launched ‘Enterprise Neptune’ to help raise money to buy and protect the\
  \ most ‘pristine’ stretches.\n\n\nIn order to understand which areas were most at\
  \ risk from development, University of Reading staff &amp; students were commissioned\
  \ to carry out a physical coastal land use survey that was lovingly recorded on\
  \ 350 OS 2.5 miles to 1 inch scale maps.\n\n\nHalf a century later, the Neptune\
  \ Coastline Campaign, has raised £65 million, enabling the National Trust to acquire\
  \ an additional 550 miles of coastline to a total of 778 miles.  To celebrate this\
  \ milestone, in 2014 the National Trust commissioned the University of Leicester\
  \ to re-survey the land use along the coast.  However, this time, digital technology\
  \ and aerial photography were the tools of choice.  By making the maps and data\
  \ publicly available, we hope they might inspire further research.\n\nFor more information\

  \ How to use the map application This map shows both the 1965 and 2014 land use\
  \ survey layers, as well as the original annotated OS maps.  As you navigate to\
  \ a coastal location, the original OS maps will be overlaid with the 2014 Land Use\
  \ layer.  To view the digital 1965 Land Use layer, select the 'Layers' icon on the\
  \ toolbar and select the required dataset.  To view additional information regarding\
  \ the layers, such as the comparison of the 1965 and 2014 land uses, select one\
  \ of the coloured areas and a pop-up box will appear.  To view what each of the\
  \ coloured areas represent, select the 'Legend' icon on the toolbar.\n\n\nAdditional\
  \ options on the toolbar include the ability for you to change the basemap (basemap\
  \ gallery), print the area of the map currently viewing, and search for specific\
  \ locations.\n\n\nTo view the application full screen, select here. Contact us If\
  \ you require any assistance with the datasets, please contact us: OpenData@NationalTrust.org.uk\
