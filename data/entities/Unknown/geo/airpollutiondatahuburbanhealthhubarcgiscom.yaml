description: 'Search and explore our data Welcome to Impact on Urban Health''s Air
  Pollution Data Hub. This is the platform for visualising and exploring data relating
  to the health effects of air pollution. Programme Goal: We want to address the health
  effects of poor air quality on people whose health is most impacted by air pollution:
  children, older people and people with heart and lung conditions Explore our data
  Choose a category Health Transportation Why we focus on the health effects of air
  pollution Air pollution is more prevalent in urban areas. And poor air quality doesn’t
  impact people in these areas equally; some people are more susceptible to its harmful
  effects than others. And we know that it intersects with other systemic causes of
  ill health. The health effects of air pollution are a product of both exposure and
  susceptibility. Air pollution therefore has a disproportionate effect on the health
  and wellbeing of those most susceptible to it. This includes children under 15 (including
  during pregnancy), older people and people with heart and lung conditions. We want
  to build evidence on what innovations work to reduce the health effects of air pollution
  equitably, particularly at a local level, on these groups. About Address: The Grain
