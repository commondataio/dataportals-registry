description: Keeping Cool in the Capital Region Capital Region Urban Heat Island Mitigation
  Project Capital Region Urban Heat Island Mitigation Project The Capital Region Urban
  Heat Island Mitigation Project, led by Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management
  District and the Local Government Commission, built detailed models of the UHI effect
  in the Sacramento region and used them to evaluate the effectiveness of a range
  of heat mitigation measures. These findings have been translated into strategies
  and recommendations to minimize the UHI effect in the Capital Region, focusing on
  the transportation sector and communities most vulnerable to extreme heat. The Sacramento
  region already bears a disproportionate heat-health burden, with the number of heat-related
  deaths and hospital visits in the region exceeding the state average (CDPH). The
  transportation sector, with its miles of highways, roads, and other paved surfaces,
  is one of the largest contributors to the UHI effect. Extreme heat also deteriorates
  pavements and other transportation infrastructure, resulting in disruptions and
  maintenance costs for taxpayers. Average Urban Heat Index Urban heat affects each
  of Sacramento's neighborhoods differently. This model shows the average temperature
  differences seen throughout the region, using temperature averages from 2016. In
  places such as Northern Sacramento, Auburn, and Lincoln, temperatures are higher
  because of heat transport from Sacramento's urban core. Read more about the urban
  heat island index and what it means for your neighborhood. Electric Vehicles in
  the Capital Region Zero-emission vehicles, including electric vehicles, can help
  to reduce extreme heat by reducing waste heat that comes from conventional gas engines,
  thus lightening the urban heat island effect. Unfortunately, in the region, electric
  vehicles are likely to face heat-related impacts on battery resistance and capacity
  due to rising temperatures. Electric vehicle investments in the Sacramento Region
  are a top priority for Sacramento Metropolitan AQMD and many other local government
  organizations. EVs have the potential to significantly cool the region, but only
  if heat resilience is considered. Community Priorities Report Community engagement
  and outreach, particularly with disadvantaged communities, is a core part of the
  project. The project team gathered input from vulnerable communities on their transportation
  needs, concerns, and priorities, with the findings to inform all aspects of the
  project and serve as a resource for other planning projects. Explore the tools Thanks
