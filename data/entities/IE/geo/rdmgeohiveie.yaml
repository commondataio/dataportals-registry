description: 'Informing and Monitoring the implementation of the 3 Regional Spatial
  and Economic Strategies (RSES) The Regional Development Monitor (RDM) Hub is a

  collaborative project between the three Regional Assemblies in Ireland, the

  All-Island Research Observatory (AIRO) at Maynooth University and spatial

  infrastructure partners the Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSI) via the GeoHive

  platform. The aim of the RDM Hub is to collate and visualise a range

  of relevant socio-economic and environmental indicators to present the

  performance of each of the three regions in terms of achieving the objectives

  outlined in their respective Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSES).

  The RDM provides a series of new national mapping and visualisation

  infrastructures to assist Government Departments, Regional Assemblies, Local

  Authorities, Planners, Policy Makers, Researchers and members of the public in

  gaining a greater insight into social, economic and environmental trends to aid

  better decision making. The RDM will focus on indicators related to the Regional

  Strategic Outcomes (RSOs) of the RSESs along with their appropriate

  socio-economic and environmental variables and will be categorised into four

  key principles: Our People and Places, Our Green &amp; Sustainable Future, Our

  Region''s Economy, and an All-Island Perspective. Analyse and Monitor the Indicators

  Strategies (RSES) A Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy (RSES) is a

  planning and economic framework that considers the future development of a

  region for a period of not less than 12 years and not more than 20 years. It is

  made by a Regional Assembly in accordance with the provisions of Chapter III of

  the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. A Regional Assembly is

  required to review an RSES every six years. An RSES identifies regional assets,

  opportunities and pressures and provides appropriate policy responses in the

  form of regional policies and objectives. A separate RSES has been published

  for each of the three Regional Assemblies. Click on the image below to view the
