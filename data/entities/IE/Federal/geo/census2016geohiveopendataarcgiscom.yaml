description: 'Open Data for Census 2016 Ireland Bringing Geography and Statistics
  Together On this site Census 2016 datasets have been combined with Tailte Éireann
  official boundary data as part of a collaborative project between the Central Statistics
  Office (CSO) and Tailte Éireann to link geography and statistics. Tailte Éireann
  Logo GeoHive logo CSO logo About Small Area Population Statistics (SAPS) are Census
  statistics produced by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) for a range of geographical
  levels including 31 Administrative Counties, 95 Municipal districts, 3,409 Electoral
  Divisions and 18,641 Small Areas. Although the statistics are collected by the CSO
  the statutory boundary data sets are administered by Tailte Éireann. On this website
  the statistical and boundary data have been fused together to provide almost 500
  layers of geo-statistical information. These layers can be visualised here as colour
  coded thematic maps or they can be downloaded as Open Data in a variety of formats
  or alternatively accessed via a set of Open APIs. Explore Data via StoryMaps Click
  on an image below to access an interactive narrative on a particular Census  2016
  Profile. Explore Data via Census Themes Click to access statistics in any of the
  15 Census themes provided below. We have used official Alias Names for the Census
  2016 Variables presented on this site. Download the Census 2016 Glossary  as a cross
  reference between the variable field names and descriptive alias names. 1. Sex,
  Age &amp; Marital Status 2. Migration, Ethnicity &amp; Religion 3. Irish Language
  4. Families 5. Private Households 6. Housing 7. Communal Establishments 8. Principal
  Status 9. Social Class &amp; Socio-Economic Group 10. Education 11. Commuting 12.

  Internet Access Boundaries Find Data Get Mapping! How to make the most of this website.
  1. Find Data Use the Search box to search for and discover data from our Catalogue.
  We have ''tagged'' the data items with Census 2016 theme categories. Tip: Just hit
  Search with no search term to view the entire Catalog. 2. Visualise Data When you
  find a Layer of interest click on any variable box to see that variable mapped and
  charted. The system will use Smart Mapping to render a thematic map of your chosen
  variable from Census 2016. Tip: If you want to change the Visualisation you can
  easily build your own webmap. 3. Build Webmaps Webmaps enable you to combine multiple
  operational layers from this site and other sites. This creates a ''map sandwich''
  of operational data layers overlayed onto a basemap. Just click on the Create Webmap
  option to pass the Layer you are working with here into ArcGIS Online''s map viewer
  where you can create, save and share your webmap. Tip: Create a Public or Organisation
  Account on ArcGIS to save your webmap. 4. Share Your Work You can Embed your Webmap
  in websites, blogs or StoryMaps using our template viewers and Share with your stakeholders.
  This is a great way to use Census 2016 to support evidence based decision making.
  Tip: Evey webmap gets a unique id, you can use it to embed the webmap using the
  basic viewer template. 5. Build Apps If you want to go beyond what the standard
  templates can do you are free to build your own Apps for web and mobile using our
  Developer APIs. Tip: All our viewers are responsive JavaScript/HTML5 so they work
  on browser and mobile devices. Instructional Videos Click on a Video below to find
  out how to use the site. cc-by Open means Open This site is a joint initiative of  CSO
  and Tailte Éireann. It was created to promote the use of Geography and Statistics
  to support evidence based decision making across the Irish Public Sector and among
  Civil Society. This site and the data it presents are Open, Public and Free to Use.

  Map Layers We have combined statistics and geography to create a set of map Layers.
  These map Layers are ready to use by both casual users and developers. If you are
  a developer - simply click on the APIs button provided with each Layer to access
  our RESTful GeoServices API or the GeoJSON API. You may also access the Esri API
  for JavaScript by creating a Developer Account. If you are a casual user - simply
  click on the Create Webmap link on the right hand side of any Item Page under the
  About heading. This will load the Layer you are using into ArcGIS Online. From here
  you can alter the visualisation and using either a Public or Organisation Account
  you can log in an save your new Webmap. Credits © 2023 Tailte Éireann Built by Esri
