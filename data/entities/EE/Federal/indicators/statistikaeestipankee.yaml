description: Statistics are published in a such way that individual people or legal
  entities cannot be identified directly or indirectly. To prevent indirect identification,
  methods of control of statistical disclosure are used to protect the values in the
  tables. The figures for the financial sector, including Eesti Pank, and the public
  sector are an exception to this, and they can also be accessed through obligatory
  public reporting.
