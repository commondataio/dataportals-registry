description: Geo-based data catalog provided by VTA (likely Transport Administration
  or similar Estonian entity focusing on roads and transport). However, the provided
  URL domain is not standard, and 'VTA' in Estonia context may refer to the Estonian
  Road Administration or Transport Administration, but the link is not standard Estonian
  gov domain. No explicit description found in search results; assumed from context
  as a geospatial data catalog for road/transport.
