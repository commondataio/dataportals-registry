description: A platform for sharing key flood data within government and with stakeholders,
  including data from flood projects under the NSW Floodplain Management Program.
  Data from government projects can be uploaded by registered users for secure storage
  and sharing. The portal does not contain the complete catalogue of flood projects
  carried out in NSW. Local councils remain the primary source of flood information
  for their service areas.
