  Initiative The City of Kitchener is committed to improving citizen engagement and
  enhancing transparency and accountability to its residents by providing public access
  to its data. Open data is data that is made freely available to the public in machine-readable
  format within the agreements of the open data license. The data currently available
  from the city is found in our data catalogue. We encourage you to explore the data
  sets. The catalogue will continue to strive to provide data in multiple formats
  wherever possible. New data sets will be added as they become available. The data
  can be downloaded as shapefiles for GIS applications, and as CSV for tables and
  spreadsheets. Advanced users may also integrate our data into other applications
  using the REST or GeoJSON API. Through your feedback, the city will prioritize the
  data sets to be delivered. If you have an idea for information that would be useful
  as open data or would like to request alternative formats or additional information
  on existing data sets your input is welcome. Please submit your idea through our  Open
