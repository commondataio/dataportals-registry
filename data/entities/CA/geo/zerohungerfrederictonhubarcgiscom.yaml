  NB Health Zone Sheet1 New Chart What is food insecurity? Food insecurity in Canada
  is defined by the inability to acquire or consume a sufficient amount of food in
  ways that are deemed socially acceptable, or the uncertainty that one will be able
  to do so. Food insecurity can be categorized in one of three ways: Who is most at
  risk of experiencing food insecurity? Individuals living on a low income Individuals
  who pay rent for their place of residence Individuals with children under 18 years
  old Individuals who are single parents What are the health implications of food
  insecurity? For adults: poorer mental healthincreased probability of infectious
  and non-infectious diseasespoorer disease managementincreased health care utilizationhigher
  mortality rates For children: poorer development and learningimpaired disease managementincreased
  likelihood of developing asthma, depression, and other chronic conditions poorer

  asthma, depression, and other chronic conditions Food insecurity in Fredericton
  and New Brunswick: 2010 to 2019 Average Food Expenditure Per Household New Brunswick
  Data New Chart In 2019, the average New Brunswick household spent $9484 on food.
  Data Table: 2010 to 2019 Average Food Expenditure Per Household New Brunswick Percent
  of Household Income Spent on Food as Forecasted for 2022 Data extracted from Community
  Analyst (2022 Forecast Household Expenditure on Food, Environics), view on City
  of Fredericton Open Data Portal. In 2021, the prevalence of marginal, moderate,
  and severe food insecurity in New Brunswick was 19%. This is ~140,000 people. Of
  these individuals, 1 in 4 are children. In 2021, New Brunswick food banks reported
  20,408 visits. Of these visits 6544 were children. Only ~14.6% of the general population
  and ~18.7% of children experiencing food insecurity access a food bank. What has
  been shown to reduce food insecurity? People who use food banks tend to be those
  experiencing severe food insecurity. However, using a food bank does not result
  in sustainable food security. Food banks are limited in the amount/type of assistance
  they can provide and households experiencing food insecurity require more than just
  food. Research shows that food insecurity can be reduced through public policies
  that improve the financial circumstances of low income households. Examples of programs
  that have had positive impacts on food insecurity: Canadian Pension Programs Canada
  Child Benefit Newfoundland &amp; Labrador Poverty Reduction Strategies These policies
  were not explicitly designed to address household food insecurity, but they had
  positive impacts on the problem because they improved incomes for households with
  very-low incomes. Households with very low-incomes are most likely to be severely
  food insecure. What is needed to achieve resilient food systems? Access to Nutritional
