  Story Map... Discover Halton''s Water Quality Streams are complex ecosystems that
  provide habitat for a wide variety of plant and animal life. When a stream is in
  a healthy state, each species can meet their habitat and nutrient requirements,
  but as the quality of the stream degrades, the number and diversity of species is
  likely to decline.


  When water quality data is studied over long time periods of time, ecologists can
  track how it is changing. This provides important information that helps to explain
  changes that are seen in the plants and animals that live in a stream. Didn''t find
