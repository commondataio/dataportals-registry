  Query, search and filter through all NTP investigated events in our interactive
  dashboard. Events are shown in a table and map view for you to explore! Download
  Data A variety of datasets are maintained for NTP events. These are organized as
  ''layers'' and can be downloaded through one of the links below: Damage Tracks Event
  Summaries (launch interactive dashboard above) Event Summary Maps These new summary
  maps provide additional information about investigated events including path length,
  path width, max wind speed and other information collected by the team. Browse the
  gallery of summary maps below or explore all event summary maps along with their
  associated datasets. Investigated events are provided in a snapshot view which are
  updated by the team as events are reported. If you''d like to search by specific
  year, province or other category there is also a searchable dashboard with links
  out to events that have an associated event summary map. NTP Surveys Satellite Surveys
  Drone Mapping Historic Data Explore NTP Data Pages High-resolution satellite imagery
  is collected in before and after pairs via Planet Labs, and is used to identify
  potential damage. Drone mapping takes place in the field, by the NTP Storm Survey
  Team, to collect high-resolution orthomosaic maps. *Coming Soon* The Michael Newark
  Digital Tornado Archive is a collection of materials related to tornado and other
  damaging wind events that will eventually date back to Canada’s first verified tornado
  in 1792. Drone Ground Aerial Satellite NTP Event Summaries Dashboard surveyPoint

  Dashboard surveyPoint Satellite Surveys Drones are used as part of NTP ground surveys
  to help identify damage paths, detect damage in areas with limited ground accessibility,
  and to take photos/video for both analysis and media purposes. Additionally, by
  flying drones over damaged areas using pre-programmed grids, orthomosaic maps can
  be generated. Orthomosaic maps consist of a series of individual photos that have
  been merged to form one corrected composite image, providing a high-resolution overview
  of the area. Ground photos and associated metadata are collected, mapped, stored
  and preserved. The NTP Storm Survey Team uses a customized web form to collect observations
  in the field of reported wind events. The form follows Environment Canada''s specifications
  for classifying wind events based on the Enhanced-Fujita Scale (EF Scale). Aerial
  Surveys are flown for select sites, the data is collected in high resolution geoTIFF
  format and uploaded to a mosaic dataset. This dataset along with the associated
  files are available for researchers to access through the Northern Tornadoes Project
  ArcGIS for Server Site. KML downloads are available through the Open Data Site.
  The NTP Storm Survey Team uses high-resolution satellite imagery provided by Planet
  to review areas of interest for signs of damage following severe weather events. (EF
  Scale). Contact the Team Report a Tornado Feedback Form Want to contact the NTP
  Storm Survey Team? They''d be happy to answer any questions you have about the project.
