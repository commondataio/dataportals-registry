  1 SDG 1 No Poverty: Stick figures representing multiple genders and ages. What is
  poverty? In Canada, poverty is often assessed by measuring the number of Canadians
  with low incomes. Canada uses several indicators to measure low income: the Market
  Basket Measure, Low Income Cut-Offs, and the Low Income Measure. Market Basket Measure
  The Market Basket Measure defines low income by a family unit''s disposable income*.
  A family is considered low income if it does not have enough disposable income to
  buy the specific goods and services that represent a basic standard of living. These
  include shelter, clothing, transportation, food, and other necessities. The 2020
  disposable income levels, also known as Market Basket Measure thresholds, for Fredericton
  are: *Disposable income is defined by StatCan as the total income after deducting
  tax, employment insurance, Canada Pension Plan, Registered Pension Plan contributions,
  union dues, child care expenses, support payments paid, public health insurance
  premiums, direct medical expenses including private insurance premiums, and communication
  technology. Low Income Cut-Offs Low Income Cut-Offs are income thresholds. If a
  family is below the low income cut-off it will devote a larger share of its income
  on the necessities of food, shelter, and clothing than the average family. A family
  is considered low income if it spends 20 percentage points more on these necessities
  than the average family. In 2020, the low income cut-offs (after tax) for Fredericton
  families with one person to seven or more are: 2020 Low Income Cutoffs After Tax

  view on City of Fredericton Open Data Portal. Who is at risk of experiencing poverty?
  Equitable economic growth must be inclusive to all genders, ages and ethnicities.
  Identifying who is impacted by poverty gives way to further opportunity to identify
  gaps in services. The following vulnerable groups experience disproportionate rates
  of poverty: Persons With Varying Abilities Recent New Canadians Unattached Individuals*
  (18-64yrs) Indigenous Peoples Single Parents *An unattached individual is someone
  who is not in an economic family. They either live alone or with others to whom
  they are not related. What else contributes to the experience of poverty? Housing
  House The cost of housing and lack of affordable housing options directly impacts
  poverty. The Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation considers housing ''acceptable''
  if it is affordable, has enough rooms to accommodate a family''s size, and is not
  in need of any major repairs. Housing is considered affordable if it cost less than
  30% of the household''s total income before tax. If housing does not meet these
  standards, the household is considered to be in core housing need. Typically, Canadians
  experiencing core housing need are deemed to be in need because of affordability
  issues. In 2016, 1,693,775 Canadians households were in core housing need. Of these
  households, 76.1% were below the affordability standard. An additional 13.8% were
  below two standards; affordability and one other.  Almost 90% of all households
  in severe housing need are low income. See the Sustainable Cities and Communities
  Hub for more information on core housing need. Food Insecurity Bunch of fruit Poverty
  and food insecurity are closely linked as those who live in poverty are likely to
  suffer from hunger or malnutrition. Food insecurity in Canada is defined by a household''s
  inability to acquire or consume a sufficient amount of food in ways that are deemed
  socially acceptable, or the uncertainty that one will be able to do so. Data shows
  that individuals living on a low income are more at risk of experiencing food insecurity.
  Food Banks Canada''s Hunger Count 2021 reported that 34.3% of individuals who visited
  a Canadian food bank listed Social Assistance as their primary source of income.
  In New Brunswick, 52.2% of visitors listed Social Assistance as their primary income.
  Research demonstrates that food insecurity can be reduced through public policies
  that improve the financial circumstances of low income households. See the Zero
  Hunger Hub for more information on food insecurity. Health Heart with medical symbol
  Poverty can have numerous affects on an individual''s health. Research suggests
  that individuals with low income have lower life expectancies, higher rates of suicide,
  and are more likely to suffer from disease. Living in poverty can also impact an
  individual''s overall health due to the associated challenges with food security
  and poor living conditions. Additionally, poverty can affect an individual''s ability
  to access health care. However, the relationship between poverty and health can
  be cyclical. If an individual is in poor health they may experience economic losses
  that will make it even harder for them to access care. If an individual is unemployed
  and does not have health insurance their out-of-pocket expenses, such as specialist
  consultations, tests, or medicines, can become unmanageable. Households may go into
  (further) dept to cover these expenses See the Good Health and Well-Being Hub for
  more information on health. Source: A Backgrounder on Poverty in Canada How can
  poverty be reduced? Income is the most impactful social determinant of health. When
  people experience poverty they lack the money to meet their basic needs. They are
  often food insecure, in core housing need, and have difficulties accessing health
  care. These individuals face countless barriers to education and employment opportunities
  and are at higher risk of dying prematurely. A Basic Income Guarantee can help solve
  all of these problems. What is a Basic Income Guarantee? A Basic Income Guarantee
  (BIG) is a universally available program that provides an unconditional income,
  in the form of a regular payment, to anyone whose income falls below a defined level.
  The BIG acts as an income floor for all peoples as it eliminates the risk of falling
  into poverty regardless of the circumstance. This program would ensure that every
  individual has their basic needs met and can live with dignity and respect. What
  are the principles of Basic Income? It is universally accessible. It is unconditional.
  Subject only to residency and income. It is sufficient income to achieve physical,
  mental, and social well-being. It respects autonomy. Individuals may use it at their
  sole discretion. It complements social services. It is not a replacement. It is
  reliable. Being delivered monthly or bi-weekly. Sources: Basic Income Coalition
