  City Sheet1 New Chart What is Core Housing Need? A household is considered to be
  in core housing need if the household falls below one or more of the adequacy, affordability
  and suitability standards. Adequate housing is not in need of any major repairs,
  according to current resident(s). Affordable housing costs less than 30% of before-tax
  household income. Suitable housing has enough bedrooms for the size and make-up
  of resident households. 93% of houses in core housing need are below affordability
  standards. 2016 CMHC Core Housing Need By Type of Need Sheet1 New Chart Data table: 2016
  CMHC Core Housing Need By Type of Need Fredericton''s Housing Landscape The Original
  Housing Continuum The Housing Continuum, as pictured above, was designed to represent
  the different forms of affordable housing that are available in a community. When
  someone is discussing affordable housing they could be referencing any part of this
  continuum. While the Housing Continuum does a great job of visualizing the different
  segments of housing, it is inherently problematic. The original continuum depicts
  a linear, left-to-right, progression from homelessness to homeownership. This leaves
  us with the impression that an individual will progress to the right from wherever
  they start on the continuum. However, this does not reflect the reality of people''s
  housing needs. Some may have housing needs that occur in different directions along
  the continuum. For others, homeownership may not be the desired final goal. For
  these reasons, we have re-envisioned the Housing Continuum based on the City of
  Kelowna''s Wheelhouse Model. We divided the continuum''s original stages into four
  categories: unhoused, safety net, housing with supports, and market housing. The
  categories are in the form of puzzle pieces to represent how the various forms of
  affordable housing are interconnected. Individuals move between the categories and
  may return to a category after leaving it. The connected puzzle pieces reflect this
  reality. Additionally, this version demonstrates our city''s need for a variety
  of housing forms and tenure. City planners, developers, and housing providers must
  ensure our city''s housing stock is equipped to meet the diverse needs of people
  from different socio-economic backgrounds and their varying life circumstances.
  (Elver, 2019) Re-envisioned Housing Continuum A Breakdown of our Re-envisioned Housing
  Continuum Unhoused As of January 2022, there were 161 individuals on Fredericton''s
  By Names List (BNL). The individuals on the list have consented to being on the
  list. Individuals on the BNL are assessed in order to understand their needs in
  relation to securing and maintaining housing. Individuals are given an acuity rating
  based on this assessment. Low Acuity means individuals who do not require intensive
  supports but may still benefit from access to affordable housing, housing listings
  and community level resources to solve their own homelessness. Medium Acuity means
  individuals or families with moderate health, mental health and/or behavioural health
  issues, but who are likely to be able to achieve housing stability with medium to
  short term access to financial and/or support services. High Acuity means individuals
  or families who need permanent housing with ongoing access to services and case
  management to remain stably housed. High Acuity + means individuals or families
  for whom the type of supportive housing they need does not currently exist. Data
