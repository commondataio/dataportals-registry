description: 'Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation
  for all UN Sustainable Development Goal 6 How do we achieve clean water and sanitation?
  Reducing Pollution Implementing Integrated Water Resources Management Minimizing
  Release of Hazardous Chemicals Eliminating Dumping Water that is safe for drinking
  and domestic use is considered Clean Water. A few examples of using water domestically

  levels by the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) to track global progress for the
  Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 6.1. The target is to achieve access for
  all to a safely managed drinking water service.  The JMP definition for each service
  level is: Access to facilities for the safe disposal of human waste, and the ability
  to maintain hygienic conditions defines basic sanitation. Garbage collection, industrial/hazardous
  waste management, and wastewater treatment and disposal are all hygienic related
  services. Poor sanitation results in waterborne diseases, which can lead to severe
  illness or death from the consummation of it. The JMP also defines 5 service levels
  for sanitation services to track global progress for the SDG target 6.2. The target
  is to achieve access for all to safely managed sanitation and hygiene services. 
  The JMP definition for each service level is: Safely Managed Who''s Impacted In
  2020, 2 billion people did not have access to safely managed drinking water services.
  From this demographic, 1.2 billion people were using basic services, 282 million
  were using limited services, 367 were using unimproved sources and 122 million people
  were drinking surface water. Data Table: 2020 Drinking Water Service Levels Quantity
  Global In terms of sanitation, 3.6 billion did not have safely managed services
  in 2020. There were 1.9 billion people with basic services, 580 million people with
  limited services, 616 million people with unimproved services and 494 million people
  practicing open defecation. 829,000 people die annually from diseases directly attributed
  to unsafe water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene practices. Data Table: 2020
  Sanitation Service Levels Quantity Global The lack of clean water and sanitation
  has the greatest impact on women and girls. They are often responsible for collecting
  water, which takes away from time at work, school or caring for family. Women and
  girls collectively spend 200 million hours every day collecting water and 266 million
  hours every day finding a place to use the washroom. River Monitoring There are
  approximately 60 000 km of streams and rivers in New Brunswick. The Department of
  Environmental and Local Government (DELG), in partnership with Environmental and
  Climate Change Canada, First Nations and non-governmental organizations conduct
  surface water quality monitoring on these streams and rivers. This creates an awareness
  on the state of the environment and contributes to making progress on the sixth
  target of SDG 6, which is to protect and restore water-related ecosystems. The available
  high quality data supports DELG''s programs and permits for planning and approvals.
  The data is collected through the Surface Water Monitoring Network, which has 62
  monitoring stations throughout the province. Samples are collected from the stations
  at least 4 times per year. The location of each station, along with the list of
  parameters that are monitored are displayed below: Source: DELG River Water Quality
  Data The above data portal allows one to select any of the listed parameters and
  view its trends for every monitoring station for a specified time frame. The majority
  of the parameters have collected data from 2003 to 2022. Alternatively, one of the
  62 monitoring stations can be selected to view its water quality data. Trends for
  each listed parameter can be viewed for the monitoring station for a specified time
  frame. Below is an example of the water quality data for the Nashwaak River above
  Marysville bridge Source: Surface Water Quality Trends for Nashwaak River above
  Marysville bridge Atlantic DataStream, an open access hub for sharing water data,
  also contains the information collected by the Surface Water Monitoring Network.
  It provides data visualization, statistics and descriptions for the monitoring stations
  recorded parameters. Water quality data from the Nashwaak Watershed Association
  can also be found in the Atlantic DataStream, along with several regional monitoring
  networks. Source: Atlantic DataStream New Brunswick Surface Water Monitoring Network
  The Water Quality Index (WQI) is a tool used to assess and interpret water quality
  data collected at the monitoring stations. DELG monitors results for 11 parameters
  (arsenic, total ammonia, chloride, copper, dissolved oxygen, iron, nitrate, pH,
  total phosphorus, turbidity, and zinc) and compares them with their respective guidelines
  to calculate the index. The WQI ranges from a score of 0 to 100. Depending on the
  score the monitoring station receives it is ranked in 1 of the 5 categories displayed
  in the table. From 2014 - 2016, the aggregated data collected was used to calculate
  the WQI scores of 53 monitoring stations. The number of sites in each category were:
  WQI IndexInterpretationExcellent (95 - 100)Water quality measurements never or very
  rarely exceed water quality guidelines.Good (80 - 94.9)Water quality guidelines
  measurements rarely exceed water quality guidelines and, if they do, it is usually
  by a narrow margin.Fair (64 - 79.9)Water quality measurements sometimes exceed water
  quality guidelines and may do so by a wide margin.Marginal (45 - 64.9)Water quality
  measurements often exceed water quality guidelines and/or exceed the guidelines
  by a considerable margin.Poor (0 - 44.9)Water quality measurements usually exceed
  water quality guidelines and/or exceed the guidelines by a considerable margin.Source: The
  State of Water Quality in New Brunswick''s Lakes and Rivers Data Table: 2014 to
  2016 Water Quality Index New Brunswick Riverbank Erosion The flow of water in a
  river, such as the back and forth movement across the floodplain, results in the
  natural erosion of the riverbank. The following human activity increases the rate
  of erosion as well: Clearing landBuilding structures that alter the course of the
  riverRemoving trees/shrubs whose roots assist riverbank stabilizationErosion releases
  sediment into the river, which in turn decreases water quality. Re-introducing native
  species along eroded sections of the river bank is a common method to reduce erosion.
  An example of a native species is a silver maple. They greatly reduce soil runoff
  and erosion along a riverbank. As silver maple forests mature along the riverbank,
  they decrease flood damages due to their ability to absorb large amounts of water;
  thus, reducing the speed and height of the flood. The canopy of these trees provide
  shade to the river to assist in temperature moderation. In partnership with the
  City of Fredericton, the Nashwaak Watershed Association is developing a strategy
  for the creation of a greenway along the banks of the Nashwaak River. 10-year management
  plans have been created for Marysville Flats and Neil''s Flats. The goal is to restore
  the silver maple dominated floodplain forests that once existed in these areas through
  active reforestation. For more information on the Nashwaak Watershed Association''s
  tree planting initiative, please visit the hub on SDG 15, Life on Land. Erosion

  to address Clean Water &amp; Sanitation in Fredericton The Nashwaak Watershed Association
  They restore land that can protect river water quality and they engage the local
  community on the value of healthy rivers.  They collect water quality data through
  portable water quality sensors and grab samples sent for laboratory analysis. Water
  quality report cards are released yearly. Data Table: 2021 Water Quality Index Nashwaak
