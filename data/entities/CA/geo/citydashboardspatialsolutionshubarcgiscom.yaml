  shares information about our community, the services the City provides, and the
  City's strategic priorities. The dashboard tracks data over time, highlighting where
  we are doing well, and where we need to focus more attention to ensure we meet the
  needs of our community. As the City’s performance, continuous improvement and innovation
  journey evolves, measures will continue to be added, including reference to levels
  of service and targets, and user experience will be enhanced. Information displayed
  represents a snapshot in time based on when the data is extracted. Please note that
  all data is subject to change and may be different than data available from other
  sources. For the best user experience, the City Dashboard is best viewed on a desktop.

  for more information? The City Dashboard provides a snapshot of key demographic
  and performance indicators. The City Dashboard uses a suite of visual analytics
  to display and communicate information about performance patterns and trends of
  the City of Hamilton. By using the power of data visualization to summarize and
  convey a large amount of information, the City Dashboard enables a user to quickly
  and effectively explore data to identify patterns and trends. View tips for navigating
