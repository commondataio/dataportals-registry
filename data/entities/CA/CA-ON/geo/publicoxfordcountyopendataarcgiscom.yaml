  Oxford County offers many geographic data services and mapping products through
  the Corporate Geographic Information System (GIS). GIS is used by staff to manage
  building permits through inspection tracking and status monitoring, and to verify
  property ownership and 911 addresses. It is used to maintain transportation networks
  for effective routing and transportation analysis, and gather information about
  the landscape to evaluate land development proposals. Oxford County uses GIS to
  provide better services to you. Online Interactive Maps Printed Maps About GIS Quick
  Links Contact Us Oxford County’s GIS model dates back to 1985, at which time it
  was called the Land Related Information System (LRIS).  The LRIS integrated information
  such as property and infrastructure data from various government systems. The LRIS
  received the prestigious Exemplary Systems in Government Award from the Urban and
  Regional Information Systems Association (URISA) in 1988.  The system is now called
  MAP-IT and is used by the County and area municipalities today and has been expanded
  to support numerous business processes including administering building permits,
  civic addressing and Public Works - work management. Online Interactive Maps'
