description: EcoPortal is a comprehensive web-based repository for ontologies and
  semantic artefacts in ecology and related domains. Part of LifeWatch ERIC (European
  Research Infrastructure Consortium), it provides tools for browsing, searching,
  annotating, and accessing semantic resources. Part of the OntoPortal Alliance, the
  portal offers ontology recommendations, text annotation services, and programmatic
  API access to create semantically enriched applications for the ecology and biodiversity
  research communities.
