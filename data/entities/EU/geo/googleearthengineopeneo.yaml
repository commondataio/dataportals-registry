description: This is the Google Earth Engine Driver for openEO. Google Earth Engine
  is a planetary-scale platform for Earth science data & analysis. It is powered by
  Google's cloud infrastructure and combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite
  imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities. Google
  makes it available for scientists, researchers, and developers to detect changes,
  map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface.
