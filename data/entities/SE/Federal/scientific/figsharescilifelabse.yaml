description: A data repository powered by Figshare, supported by SciLifeLab and the
  Knut and Alice Wallenberg foundation through the Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS)
  program, and the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF). It allows life
  science researchers in Sweden to publish and share any kind of research-related
  data, such as documents, figures, or presentations. The repository is not limited
  to restricted data sharing or temporary storage; all data is expected to be public
  at some point, though embargo and metadata-only records are supported for controlled
  access. It is not meant for non-public or exclusively shared data. Data is citable
  via DOI and can be integrated with publication, funding, and version control systems.
