description: A user-friendly web-based data publication platform that allows researchers
  to store, annotate and publish research datasets of any size to ensure long-term
  preservation and availability of their data. The service allows any dataset to be
  stored, independent of volume, number of files and structure. A published dataset
  is enriched with complex metadata, unique identifiers are added and the data is
  preserved for an agreed-upon period of time. The service is domain-agnostic and
  supports multiple communities with different policy and metadata requirements.
