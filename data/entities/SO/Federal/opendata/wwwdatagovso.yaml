description: Official open data portal of the Government of Somalia providing comprehensive
  access to government datasets and public sector information through a CKAN-based platform.
  The portal enables citizens, researchers, developers, and organizations to discover, access,
  download, and reuse government data across multiple domains including economy, health,
  education, population, and public administration. The platform promotes transparency,
  accountability, evidence-based decision-making, and innovation in public service delivery
  by making government data freely available in machine-readable formats with API access
  for programmatic data retrieval and integration.
