description: The Bioresource Collection and Research Center (BCRC), originally named
  the Culture Collection and Research Centre (CCRC) at FIRDI, was launched in 1982
  and established for industrial purpose. BCRC is mainly funded by the Ministry of
  Economic Affairs (MOEA) and is the only institute appointed by the Intellectual
  Property Office, MOEA for the deposit of patent-related biological materials. BCRC
  is not only an “Agricultural Microorganisms Bank” of the Council of Agriculture,
  but also the core facility of National Health Research Institute for “Cell Bank”.
  BCRC is the most systematic and service-oriented bioresource center (BRC) in Asia,
  and has been a member of World Federation for Culture Collections (WFCC) since 1984.
  The mission of BCRC is innovation, value-addition and creation. BCRC will continue
  to assist the development of biotech-related industries in Taiwan by providing customized
  and value-added services based on the science and technology in the biological resources
  to promote industrial activities and create industrial values. Furthermore, BCRC
  joined GBIF and became data provider in 2009. To date, BCRC uses IPT with the Darwin
  Core standard to reach the goal of microbial data exchange.
