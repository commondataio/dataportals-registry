description: 'Belize AFI Study Baylor College of Medicine | CDC Central America |
  Belize Ministry of Health Baylor College of Medicine, in collaboration with CDC
  Central America and Belize Ministry of Health, has implemented an acute febrile
  illness (AFI) screening initiative in Belize. Our current program aims to maximize
  the countries ability to understand, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats
  in the high-risk regions of Belize. We are working to identify patients presenting
  with AFI and detect vector-borne, respiratory, and enteric pathogens so diseases
  can be monitored and interventions targeted. Enrollment is ongoing at 11 Hospitals
  and clinics across Belize (black dots on map). Reports of the the overall finding
  from the study to-date as well as findings from each individual enrollment sites
  are linked below. AFI enrollment locations Reports from individual enrollment sites
