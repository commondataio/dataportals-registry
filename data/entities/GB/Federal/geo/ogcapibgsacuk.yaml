description: This server provides OGCAPI endpoints for a selection of BGS open geospatial
  data. The BGS has a wide range of datasets and wants to increase access to these,
  publishing as many as possible under Open Government Licence. Not all datasets are
  available under OGL, please check the metadata record for the dataset to confirm
  any licence requirements and obligations if not OGL. This is a BETA API service,
  endpoints and attributes could change at any time, unscheduled downtime should be
  expected.
