description: The figshare service for the University of Sheffield allows researchers
  to store, share and publish research data. It helps the research data to be accessible
  by storing Metadata alongside datasets. Additionally, every uploaded item receives
  a Digital Object identifier (DOI), which allows the data to be citable and sustainable.
  If there are any ethical or copyright concerns about publishing a certain dataset,
  it is possible to publish the metadata associated with the dataset to help discoverability
  while sharing the data itself via a private channel through manual approval.
