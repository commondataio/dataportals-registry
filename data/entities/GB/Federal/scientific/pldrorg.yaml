description: The PLDR brings together datasets that track changes in the determinants
  of health and health outcomes, in places over time. These are used by researchers,
  local government, the NHS and the third sector to understand what works to improve
  public and health outcomes, what doesn’t and what can cause harm. The PLDR uses
  local and national datasets (e.g. hospital admissions data, budgetary data, prescribing
  data) to calculate indicators for places (neighbourhoods, local government areas,
  regions and countries) that are consistent over time.
