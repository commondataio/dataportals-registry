description: The Durham High-Energy Physics Database (HEPData) has been built up over
  the past four decades as a unique open-access repository for scattering data from
  experimental particle physics. It currently comprises the data points from plots
  and tables related to several thousand publications including those from the Large
  Hadron Collider (LHC). HEPData is funded by a grant from the UK STFC and is based
  at the IPPP at Durham University.
