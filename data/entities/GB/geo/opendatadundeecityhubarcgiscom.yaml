description: Welcome to the Dundee Open Data Hub The Dundee open data hub is a free
  platform where anyone can discover open spatial data about Dundee. Some other (mostly
  non-spatial) open data is currently available at data.dundeecity.gov.uk, but will
  soon be moved here. Featured Data Latest Data European Funding This Hub is supported
  via the Scottish 8th City Smart Cities programme, which is part funded via the European
  Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), and specifically via the European Regional
  Development Fund (ERDF). The aim of ERDF is to strengthen economic and social cohesion
  by correcting imbalances between regions.
