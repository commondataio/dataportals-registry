  Putting the power of population data into your hands. An interactive web map that
  allows you to explore population estimates along with measures of uncertainty for
  specific locations and demographic groups using bespoke population models from the
  WorldPop Open Population Repository  (WOPR). Produce your own gridded population
  estimates from building maps using the "peanut butter" method: Spread your estimates
  of average household size evenly across buildings in each settlement type using
  high resolution maps of building footprints from recent satellite imagery. Data
  on subnational population age-sex structures has been obtained through employing
  a number of sources to ensure the finest sub-national detail and representativeness
  for all areas included. The WorldPop Data Portal allows users to query and download
  rasters produced by the WorldPop research group.The tool allows the delineation
  of areas to query, returning zonal statistics. Explore More Apps Connect to WorldPop
