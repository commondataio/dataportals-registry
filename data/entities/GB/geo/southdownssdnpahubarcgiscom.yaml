  formally adopted by the South Downs National Park Authority on Tuesday 2 July 2019.  The
  Local Plan is part of the statutory development plan for the whole National Park,
  along with the minerals and waste plans and ‘made’ (adopted) Neighbourhood Development
  Plans (NDP). It sets out how we will manage development over the period 2014 to
  2033. All Local Plan policies and Neighbourhood Plan policies should be viewed together
