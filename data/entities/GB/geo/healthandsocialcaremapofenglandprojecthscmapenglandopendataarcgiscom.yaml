description: Welcome to the Health and Social Care Map of England The Health and Social
  Care Map of England (or HSC Map of England), is a voluntary resource to help share
  information and advice on health, social care and community data assets through
  the use of interactive maps. Please contact hscmapengland@gmail.com if you have
  any questions or require any support. Thank you. As of April 2023 the focus is on
  the Yorkshire and Humberside region and Bradford district specifically. The national HSC
  Map of England is still available but the data is not currently being maintained.
  The data will be available via Excel files and Power BI reports that are being developed.
