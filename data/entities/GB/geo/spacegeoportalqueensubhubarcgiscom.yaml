description: For Health and Environment Research, Policy and Action The SPACE project
  is investigating factors in the environment that may influence health as we age.
  This hub is a platform for exploring and downloading Geographic Information Systems
  (GIS) data relating to that research. In this portal, you can search the catalogue
  of available data, visualise it and download it. Explore the Data The categories
  below relate to environmental variables which influence health and healthy ageing
  in our environment. These factors include, for example, light pollution, noise pollution,
  air pollution and soil pollution, as well as built infrastructure and availability
  of ‘green space’ and ‘blue space’. Land Cover Climate Air and Emissions Noise and
