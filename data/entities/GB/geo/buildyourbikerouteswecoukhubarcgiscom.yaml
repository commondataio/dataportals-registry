  is an online toolkit that provides support in creating concept Active Travel routes,
  for use in funding applications. Build Your Bike Route icon How it works The aim
  of the toolkit is to break down the process of Active Travel inception design into
  discrete sections, and make the process and understanding more accessible. It takes
  time and resources to become an expert in all things Active Travel, so we aim to
  reduce this investment of time by explaining what we think is important for users
  to understand, and also what funders are looking for. It contains several pages
  to navigate through, which breakdown details of Active Travel design and funding.
  It also allows for routes, drawn on this system, to be scored against geospatial
  data to better understand and quantify routes. Knowledge Centre Each section below
  provides information about an aspect of Active Travel design, from the inception
  of an idea to the journey you will go on to realise this idea, as well as more technical
  details of construction and Health &amp; Safety. Explore your Area of Interest Find
  your area of interest on the map and explore the different information layers to
  identify your preferred new route. Unlock the Data and 3D Visualisations Use the
  shared data and 3D visualisations to get new insights of your area of interest. Explore,
  visualise, analyse and the data, or download raw data and media files at no cost,
  share your insights with your co-workers, and use that in combination with your local
  knowledge and expertise to design a new route. Non-Motorised Users Geodemographics
