description: About the Catchment Based Approach The Catchment Based Approach (CaBA)
  is a community-led approach that engages people and groups from across society to
  help improve our precious water environments. CaBA Partnerships are now actively
  working in 100+ catchments across England and Wales. CaBA partnerships make use
  of the best available data and evidence to develop a shared understanding of the
  problems in their catchments, so that they can effectively target their actions
  and funds where they will have multiple benefits for people and wildlife. Find your
  local CaBA Partnership Subscribe for Updates Keep up with the latest news &amp;
  announcements Using Data &amp; Evidence CaBA partnerships make use of the best available
  data and evidence to develop a shared understanding of the issues and target their
  actions and funds where they will have multiple benefits for all the partners. Our
  Focus The growing availability of Open Data, combined with advances in mobile and
  online mapping software and wider access to fast broadband, have enabled CaBA partnerships
  to make better use of data and evidence to work more effectively in collaboration.
  River Soar Catchment Mapping Portal Evidence Sharing Platforms Effective visualisation
  of data through maps, infographics and other media helps develop an understanding
  of complex environmental systems, builds confidence and eases communication between
  a wide range of people and organisations who need to work in partnership to improve
  the water environment. Story Map templates, developed by The Rivers Trust and shared
  with CaBA partnerships, have enabled better data sharing between organisations and
  local communities by visualising complex information in a way everyone can understand. This
  helps people from government, businesses and charities, who all have very different
  priorities, language and culture, to develop a shared vision for their catchment.
  View Gallery Mobile Data Collection Using mobile data collection makes it easier
  to collaborate and build shared databases with your partners so that you can build
  a shared local evidence base. Replace unreliable paper-based forms and collect data
  in the field via web or mobile devices, even when disconnected from the internet.
  Mobile data collection allows you to analyze results quickly, automate processes,
  and upload data securely for further analysis and sharing. There are a number of
  data collection templates that have been developed across CaBA for field surveys
  and citizen science. You can also check out Survey123 and Collector for ArcGIS to
  get started and create your own data collection apps. If you are not an ArcGIS subscriber,
  you can also access open source data collection apps like EpiCollect5 or SurveyCTO.

  You shouldn't have to be a data scientist to be able to access, analyse and interpret
  data for catchment planning. The CaBA Technical Support Team aims to provide ongoing
  support, guidance and training to all CaBA partnerships, building capacity and enabling
  them to develop a local evidence base. You can submit a support request or get started
  with our training videos and learning resources. Citizen Science Did you know that
  more than 14,000 citizen scientists were involved in their CaBA catchment partnership
  last year? CaBA has a growing community of citizen scientists who are committed
  to monitoring their water environment. The data collected is extremely valuable
  and helps partnerships to identify problem areas and prioritise catchment improvements.
