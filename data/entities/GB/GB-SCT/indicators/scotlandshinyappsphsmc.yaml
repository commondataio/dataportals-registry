description: The metadata catalogue has been developed by Public Health Scotland to
  provide metadata on easily accessible, publicly available health and wellbeing indicators
  for Scotland. It provides information on what data is available, but the metadata
  catalogue does not provide the actual data. It has been developed to make it easier
  to find and use existing intelligence for learning and decision-making related to
  health and wellbeing. The catalogue includes data from Public Health Scotland, as
  well as from other data owners such as the Office for National Statistics, National
  Records of Scotland and the Scottish Government. Indicators from each publication
  are grouped by health and wellbeing category, providing an overview of available
  metrics by topic. Each indicator has a metadata profile that provides available
  details on that item, for example, frequency of data updates, categorical breakdowns
  and data source.
