description: The Research Data Gouv platform is the national federated platform for
  open and shared research data serving the national scientific community. This platform
  was an integral part of the Second National Plan for Open Science (PNSO) and offers
  a multidisciplinary data repository, a registry which reports data hosted in other
  repositories and a web portal. The multidisciplinary repository is a sovereign publishing
  solution for sharing and opening up data for communities which are yet to set up
  their own recognised thematic repository.
