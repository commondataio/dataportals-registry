description: Website related to CARTO's services for geospatial data, likely part
  of a regional or local data catalog (possibly linked to 'le64' domains such as data.le64.fr,
  which are related to the Département des Pyrénées-Atlantiques, France). Since the
  url is not found in the provided sources and its content is not accessible via search
  results, I cannot extract direct or detailed metadata. However, based on standard
  practices and the provided schema, here is the best possible output using the vocabularies
  specified and common content for CARTO-based portals.
