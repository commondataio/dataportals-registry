description: SISMER (Scientific Information Systems for the Sea) is Ifremer's service
  in charge of managing numerous marine databases and information systems which Ifremer
  is responsible for implementing. The information systems managed by SISMER range
  from CATDS (SMOS satellite data) to geoscience data (bathymetry, seismics, geological
  samples), not forgetting water column data (physics and chemistry, data for operational
  oceanography – Coriolis - Copernicus CMEMS), fisheries data (Harmonie), coastal
  environment data (Quadrige 2) and deep-sea environment data (Archimède). SISMER
  therefore plays a pivotal role in marine database management both for Ifremer and
  for many national, European and international projects.
