description: Directly provided from the site content as requested, but without visiting
  the underlying pages, only the information extractable from the URL and its description
  is provided below. For complete and precise extraction of owner_type_reference,
  data_theme, and iso19115_theme, a full HTML scrape of the catalog's main and dataset
  pages is required. The following is based on mapping only from what can be inferred
  from the provided URL and standard vocabularies, not from actual web scraping or
  site content.
