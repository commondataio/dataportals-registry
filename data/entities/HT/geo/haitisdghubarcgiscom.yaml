description: "The SDG Haiti Hub \n   SUPPORTS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF\n      Haiti's social,\
  \ economic, \n      people and environmental \n      goals by 2030. ABOUT US Welcome\
  \ to Haiti's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) data hub. The hub helps monitor\
  \ progress on the Sustainable Development Goals, promotes exploration, analysis,\
  \ and collaboration using authoritative SDG data sources for evidence-based decision-making\
  \ and advocacy. Our goal is to enable data providers, managers and users to discover,\
  \ understand, and communicate patterns and interrelationships, and enable decision\
  \ makers to identify needs and establish collaborations to advance toward the equitable\
  \ achievement of the SDGs in Haiti. The SDG Haiti Hub tracks progress in achieving\
  \ our Sustainable Development Goals.  Explore the site to see nationwide and regional\
  \ progress and benchmark data on Haiti's progression to the SDGs. Set by the  United\
  \ Nations  in 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals  provide a shared blueprint\
  \ for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. The\
  \ SDGs  are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing\
  \ - in a global partnership. In this section, you are able to view Haiti’s data\
  \ per Sustainable Development Goal. SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities Before the pandemic\
  \ hit, modest gains had been made in reducing inequality in some areas, for instance,\
  \ reducing income inequality in some countries, continuing preferential trade status\
  \ to lower-income countries, and reducing transaction costs of remittances. However,\
  \ inequality persists in its various forms, whether income, wealth, opportunities\
  \ or other dimensions. The COVID-19 pandemic is now exacerbating existing inequalities\
  \ within and among countries and hitting the most vulnerable people and the poorest\
  \ countries hardest and is projected to push back the poorest countries a full 10\
  \ years on their SDG progress. Globally, refugees were at the highest absolute number\
  \ on record in 2020. Even amidst strict COVID-19 mobility restrictions across the\
  \ globe, thousands of migrants died along the migratory journey. Explore the data\
  \ Follow Haiti's progress on the Sustainable Development Goals. The data can be\
  \ downloaded in various formats and explored on an interactive map. Community Action\
  \ If you are interested in learning more about the SDG Data Hub, leave us your information\
  \ and a brief description  and we will get back to you. Achieving the SDGs for all\
  \ communities in Haiti requires everyone’s actions. Engage with the work of the\
  \ Haitian Government and its private, multilateral and non-governmental partners\
  \ to participate in the achievement of long-term and sustainable outcomes, processes,\
  \ relationships, and decisions that affect your community!"
