description: This IPT installation has been setup by Aarhus University on behalf of
  DanBIF (Danish Biodiversity Information Facility). The primary purpose of this IPT,
  is to serve biodiversity datasets that are owned by Danish instituions. As a secondary
  purpose, it also serves datasets for other institutions around the world, that do
  not have the technical infrastructure to serve their own datasets. In a broad sense,
  this IPT exists to serve the scientific community by facilitating sharing of biodiversity
  data through the GBIF network.
