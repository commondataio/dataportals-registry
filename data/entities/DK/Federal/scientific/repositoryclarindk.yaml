description: The CLARIN-DK repository is a digital infrastructure offering data, tools
  and services to support research based on language resources. It aims to ensure
  that digital language resources are made available to a broad community on a long-term
  basis, with metadata and persistent identifiers for citation, and supports open
  access with possible restrictions for legal, privacy, or ethical reasons. The repository
  does not process or alter primary data but allows new versions and associated metadata
  updates. Metadata is created according to ISO 24622-1 (CMDI), with support for interoperability
  standards like MARC21, DublinCore, and HTML.
