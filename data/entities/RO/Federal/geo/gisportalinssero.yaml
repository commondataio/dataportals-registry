description: The Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language since the
  late 9th or early 8th century BCE. It is derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet,
  and was the first alphabetic script in history to have distinct letters for vowels
  as well as consonants. In its classical and modern forms, the alphabet has 24 letters,
  ordered from alpha (Αα) to omega (Ωω). The Greek alphabet is the ancestor of the
  Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Aside from its use in writing the Greek language, in
  both its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a
  source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and
  other fields.
