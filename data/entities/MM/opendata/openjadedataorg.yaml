description: Data Stories explore the impact of the jade industry in Myanmar through
  data visualizations, analyses, and interviews. Jade can be worth up to millions
  of dollars per kilogram. The green-hued gemstone fuels an industry that is worth
  billions. The main market for jade is in China, where it has traditionally been
  highly valued and associated with royalty. Myanmar's Kachin State, where the world's
  richest jade mines are located, is on China's southern border.
