description: Geo data portal provided by the 'Konferenz der kantonalen Geoinformations-
  und Katasterstellen'. In Switzerland, the basic geodata catalog is a catalog-like
  listing of all geodata that have been collected by a legal authority by linking
  them to underlying legal enactments. In addition to a visualization of the geo data
  recorded by geo information law, its function is the database-specific assignment
  of responsible bodies and other legally relevant attributes.
