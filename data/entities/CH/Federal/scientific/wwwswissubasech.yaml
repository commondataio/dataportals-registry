description: SWISSUbase is a unique research data repository in Switzerland. It supports
  multidisciplinary data archiving with rich discipline-specific and multilingual
  metadata. The platform offers several discipline-specific metadata schemas, currently
  available for linguistics and social sciences, with humanities to be added in 2025.
  Data on SWISSUbase is curated by professional data curators at partner institutions,
  ensuring high-quality, well-documented datasets that can be easily shared, reused,
  and preserved long-term.
