description: A central data catalogue for storing the metadata of data taken at the
  Photon Science facilities SLS and SwissFEL in the form of datasets. Each dataset
  is uniquely identified with a globally unique persistent identifier (PID). The data
  are tagged with metadata and can be archived in a Petabyte Archive System. The system
  enables scientists to catalogue their data safely for long-term, allowing the data
  to be annotated and published in agreement with the FAIR principles.
