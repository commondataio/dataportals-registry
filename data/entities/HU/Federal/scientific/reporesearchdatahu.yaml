description: 'The repository was originally created as Concorda, an ad-hoc initiative
  for data exchange during the Covid-19 pandemic by HUN-REN Institute for Computer
  Science and Control (SZTAKI) and HUN-REN Wigner Research Centre for Physics (WIGNER).
  Since then, the repository was significantly expanded with additional disk space
  and other resources donated by SZTAKI and WIGNER institutes, and accepts data from
  all Hungarian researchers (with some storage constraints). In 2021, the ARP project
  started to build research data infrastructure for the Hungarian Research Network,
  and chose it as the main repository component to be integrated, while also significantly
  expanding its storage capacity. See also: https://researchdata.hu/ https://fairsharing.org/4585
