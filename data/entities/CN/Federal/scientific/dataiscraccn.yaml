description: A comprehensive database that records datasets collected from wide-ranging
  developmental stages, across different species and omics datasets, including transcriptomics,
  single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics, with plans to expand to genomics and
  proteomics. It provides lineage differentiation-related genes and allows exploration
  of gene expression changes associated with lineage differentiation from early embryogenesis
  to postnatal development, and includes data from aged individuals. All data is available
  for direct download.
