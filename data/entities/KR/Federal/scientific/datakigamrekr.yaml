description: Operated by the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM),
  the Geo Big Data Open Platform focuses on managing and preserving national geological
  data, including research datasets, thematic maps, and reports. It provides integrated
  search and visualization (2D/3D) of geological thematic maps, and allows users to
  overlay their own GIS data with large-scale geological maps. The platform also offers
  information services such as multiplatform geoscience information, marine geological
  geophysical map data, geoenvironmental information verification, earthquake research
  information, and more.
