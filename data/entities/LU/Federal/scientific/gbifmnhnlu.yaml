description: This IPT has been configured for a thematic portal on Natura 2000 species
  and other species for conservation interest in the Greater region. It is not being
  used for contributing data to GBIF, because the MNHNL is contributing all its datat
  to BioCASE and through that channel it gets fed into GBIF's data portal.
