description: The STRATEG system is a publicly accessible system, which is updated
  quarterly and designed to facilitate the process of monitoring the development and
  evaluating the effects of actions undertaken to strengthen social cohesion. The
  database contains a comprehensive set of key measures to monitor (mainly annual)
  development at the national level, as well as at lower levels of territorial division.
  To ensure international comparability, the database also contains the main indicators
  for the EU, its member states and regions at NUTS 2 level.
