description: ArcGIS REST services geoportal providing comprehensive geospatial data
  and mapping services for agricultural and plant-related information in Malaysia.
  Operated by the Department of Agriculture Malaysia (DOA), this geoportal offers
  access to agricultural datasets, crop mapping layers, and geospatial services related
  to plant cultivation, agricultural planning, crop monitoring, and land management.
  The portal serves as a primary source for agricultural spatial information, land
  use data, soil information, crop distribution maps, and geographic reference materials
  essential for agricultural research, planning, policy development, and sustainable
  farming practices in Malaysia. The portal enables stakeholders to discover, visualize,
  and access geospatial resources through standardized REST API endpoints and web
  mapping services for agricultural applications. This geoportal supports precision
  agriculture, food security initiatives, and evidence-based decision making for Malaysia's
  agricultural sector through open access to authoritative geospatial data and services.
