description: The ACSS Dataverse is an initiative of the Arab Council for the Social
  Sciences, in collaboration with the Odum Institute for Research in Social Science
  at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The ACSS Dataverse contains
  social science datasets produced in Arab countries, with the goal of making data
  available for research in the region and preserving data for future generations
  of researchers. There is no charge for access to datasets in the ACSS Dataverse,
  although users are requested to register in order to download data. The ACSS Dataverse
  encourages social scientists who study the Arab region to participate in this initiative
  by depositing data.
