  - Study of biodiversity, structural and functional organization, stability and productivity
  of taiga and tundra ecosystems; - Biological action of ionizing radiation and other
  physico-chemical factors on cells, living organisms and natural ecosystems; problems
  of radiation and ecological genetics; - Study of physiological-biochemical basis
  of adaptation and reproduction of plants in cold climates; - Study of biologically
  active compounds in plants of natural flora and introduced plants; - Development
  of methods for monitoring, bioindication; creation of inventories and databases
  of biological resources of the European North-East with the use of remote sensing
