description: Lithuanian Data Archive for Social Sciences and Humanities (LiDA) is
  a virtual digital infrastructure for data acquisition, long-term preservation and
  dissemination. It provides access to more than 700 datasets. All the international
  and national data resources are documented in both Lithuanian and English. Access
  to the data is provided via this Dataverse repository (not all the datasets are
  available, as in 2019-2021 a migration project from the old infrastructure is being
  implemented). LiDA curates most of the data collected conducting the most important
  international social surveys in Lithuania â€“ the European Social Survey, European
  Values Studies, European Election Studies and the International Social Research
  Program. LiDA is hosted by the Centre for Data Analysis and Archiving of Kaunas
  University of Technology (data.ktu.edu).
