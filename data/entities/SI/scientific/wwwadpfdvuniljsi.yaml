description: Central Slovenian Social Science Data Archives of the University of Ljubljana,
  established in 1997. The tasks include acquiring significant data sources with a
  wide range of social science disciplines relevant to Slovenian social scientists,

  scientific, educational, and other purposes. ADP offers access to data for social
  science analysis, with emphasis on problems related to Slovenian society. Priority
  is given to theoretically significant and methodologically well-designed studies,
  especially data over time and international comparative data that include Slovenia.
