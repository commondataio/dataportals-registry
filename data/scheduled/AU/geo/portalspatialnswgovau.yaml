description: The NSW Spatial Collaboration Portal provides a secure platform to facilitate
  the delivery of NSW spatial datasets, enabling search and discovery for all citizens
  and supporting data delivery, asset management, and visualization for local, state,
  and federal agencies. Open data is available to view without registration; registration
  is required for secured data and content management. The portal supports various
  spatial datasets, including administrative boundaries, land parcel and property,
  geocoded addressing, transport, imagery, cadastre, and topographic maps.
