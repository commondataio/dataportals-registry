description: CivicData is the only open government platform that brings together highly-actionable up-to-date government data from multiple agencies in a single location. CivicData enables agencies to unlock the value of open data without digging into their budgets. Built on open source using CKAN, a secure platform also used by the federal government’s data.gov, the UK, Australia, Open Colorado and many local and state jurisdictions. Governments provide infrastructure, like roads, sewers, and transit systems, that support economic and business development.
