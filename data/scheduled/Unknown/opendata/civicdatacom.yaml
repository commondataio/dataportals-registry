description: CivicData is the only open government platform that brings together highly-actionable
  up-to-date government data from multiple agencies in a single location. CivicData
  enables agencies to unlock the value of open data without digging into their budgets.
  Built on open source using CKAN, a secure platform also used by the federal governmentâ€™s
  data.gov, the UK, Australia, Open Colorado and many local and state jurisdictions.
  Governments provide infrastructure, like roads, sewers, and transit systems, that
  support economic and business development.
