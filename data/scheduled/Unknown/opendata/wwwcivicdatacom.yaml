description: The only open government platform that brings together highly-actionable
  up-to-date government data from multiple agencies in a single location. It enables
  agencies to unlock the value of open data without digging into their budgets and
  supports building scalable solutions across multiple jurisdictions. The platform
  is built on open source using CKAN, a best-in-breed open source platform also used
  by data.gov, the UK, Australia, and many local and state jurisdictions.
