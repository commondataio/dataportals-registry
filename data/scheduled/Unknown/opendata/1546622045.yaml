description: You must use the vocabularies and instructions provided. The output should
  be a sample structure in CSV format. As no raw text or content was extracted from
  the given URL and there are no actual metadata examples, the output will follow
  the schema only, with placeholders in the 'value' fields for each row. This is a
  schema template for the extractionâ€”the actual metadata values should be filled in
  once they are available.
