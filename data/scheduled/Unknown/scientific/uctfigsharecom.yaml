description: 'The University of Cape Town (UCT) uses Figshare for institutions for
  their data repository, which was launched in 2017 and is called ZivaHub: Open Data
  UCT. ZivaHub serves principal investigators at the University of Cape Town who are
  in need of a repository to store and openly disseminate the data that support their
  published research findings. The repository service is provided in terms of the
  UCT Research Data Management Policy. It provides open access to supplementary research
  data files and links to their respective scholarly publications (e.g. theses, dissertations,
  papers et al) hosted on other platforms, such as OpenUCT.'
