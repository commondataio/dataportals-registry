description: Figshare is a cloud-based institutional repository for storing, sharing,
  and publishing research outputs including datasets, files, articles, and other digital
  content. It supports a wide range of metadata and visibility options, including

  (DOIs), categorized, and mapped to common metadata standards like DataCite.
