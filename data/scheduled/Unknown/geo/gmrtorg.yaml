description: A multi-resolutional compilation of edited multibeam sonar data collected
  by scientists and institutions worldwide, that is reviewed, processed and gridded
  by the GMRT Team and merged into a single continuously updated compilation of global
  elevation data. The synthesis began in 1992 as the Ridge Multibeam Synthesis (RMBS),
  was expanded to include multibeam bathymetry data from the Southern Ocean, and now
  includes bathymetry from throughout the global and coastal oceans. GMRT is included
  in the ocean basemap in Google Earth (since June 2011) and the GEBCO compilation
  since 2014.
