description: The URL points to an ArcGIS REST API endpoint, which is typically used
  for geospatial data services. As it is not a data catalog in the conventional DCAT
  or DCAT-AP sense, and does not provide explicit metadata as per the required vocabularies,
  the following fields are extractable based on the URL and available context.
