description: Direct extraction from raw text without access to the webpage or its
  schema/metadata is not feasible. For extracting owner type, data theme, and ISO
  19115 theme as per your schema, you would need the actual page content or at least
  a sample of its HTML/metadata, not just the URL. Please provide more details, HTML
  code, or metadata snippet for extraction, or use a web scraping tool directly on
  the site.
