description: NARCIS (National Academic Research and Collaborations Information System)
  was the national portal for scientific information, research data, research software,
  descriptions of research projects, and more, provided by DANS, the Dutch national
  expertise center and repository for research data. It aggregated metadata of publications
  and datasets from Dutch universities, scientific institutions, and data archives,
  and also included research projects, experts, and research institutes. NARCIS services
  were terminated on 3 July 2023, and the content is now available via the successor
  'Portal of Research Output from the Netherlands'. The focus was on disseminating
  Open Access publications and datasets.
