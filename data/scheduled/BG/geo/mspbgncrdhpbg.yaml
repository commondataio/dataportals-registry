description: This is a data catalog URL for a REST services endpoint, possibly part
  of a larger geospatial data portal. Based on the limited information provided, it
  is not possible to extract detailed metadata such as owner_type_reference, data_theme,
  or iso19115_theme directly from the raw URL alone. For a more accurate and complete
  extraction, structured metadata or further site inspection would be required.
