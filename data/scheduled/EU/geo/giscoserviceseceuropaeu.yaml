name: The URL provided is not an actual entry in a catalog metadata registry, but
  rather a web service portal for maps (GISCO Services by the European Commission).
  It does not provide structured catalog metadata for a DCAT-AP compliant data catalog,
  nor does it expose machine-readable metadata according to your schema (owner_type_reference,
  data_theme, iso19115_theme, etc.) via the landing page or API call (as of current
  knowledge). Therefore, no structured metadata can be extracted from this URL that
  matches your requested schema.
