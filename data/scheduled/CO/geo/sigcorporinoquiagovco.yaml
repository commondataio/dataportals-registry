description: Data catalog endpoint providing RESTful services, possibly spatial and
  environmental data related to Corporinoquia (regional environmental authority in
  Colombia). Metadata below is inferred only for illustrative purposes; note that
  provided vocabularies are for assignment, and the actual values would need to be
  extracted from the catalog's metadata or documentation. The following assignments
  are possible, but not authoritative without access to underlying metadata. To comply
  strictly with your schema and not hallucinate, a *minimal output* is given below,
  with placeholders as required fields that must be set by a human or extracted from
  metadata.
