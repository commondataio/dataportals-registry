name: The response will be based on your request, but there is no actual data in the
  provided URL that can be automatically parsed or described using your specified
  vocabularies. If you provide a structured data dump (in HTML, JSON, etc.) or a metadata
  description for that website, I can extract the requested fields. Otherwise, the
  best I can do is show how the schema would look in JSON and CSV, based on your requirements.
